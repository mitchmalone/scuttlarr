# AGENTS.md — launcharr

> _An app launcher for pirates._ Always lowercase.

A macOS app launcher that dresses up as a shell prompt: global hotkey summons a floating
REPL-looking panel; type to fuzzy-launch apps and System Settings panes, or `!command` to fling
a command at Ghostty. Full product truth lives in `docs/PRD.md`. Two values govern every
decision: **lightweight** (idle invisibly, summon instantly) and **hackable** (extending it
feels like scripting). When a feature and the weight budget conflict, the feature loses.

## Standard

This project follows the jig standard, vendored at `docs/STANDARDS.md`. This file carries
**deltas only** — identity, stack, invariants, and the Rust rules the standard doesn't cover.
Divergences live in `DEVIATIONS.md`, never silently.

## Docs system

Stable rules live here; volatile state lives in `docs/`. **Docs link, never duplicate —
single source of truth per fact.** `docs/STATUS.md` is the cursor, `docs/ROADMAP.md` carries
milestones with triggers, `docs/JOURNAL.md` (append-only) dated gotchas, `docs/DECISIONS.md`
(append-only) lightweight ADRs, `docs/plans/` per-task plans (`_TEMPLATE.md` → `active/` →
`done/`), `LEARNINGS.md` the pruned per-topic reference promoted from JOURNAL.

Session protocol: read `STATUS.md` + `plans/active/` at start; plan before non-trivial work;
record decisions/gotchas as they happen; at close update `STATUS.md` and move the plan to
`done/` — **in the same commit as the code**.

## Repository shape

pnpm monorepo:

| Path            | What it is                                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/desktop`  | The macOS app — Tauri 2 shell (Rust) + React panel UI (WKWebView)          |
| `apps/www`      | launcharr.com — static-export Next.js marketing site (Vercel)              |
| `packages/core` | The shared engine: grammar, fuzzy matcher, ranking, rows — pure TypeScript |

The only external repo is the generated satellite `mitchmalone/homebrew-tap` (shared tap; `Casks/launcharr.rb`),
written by the release pipeline — fix the generator, not the output.

**Rust owns the OS, TypeScript owns the experience.** Anything touching AppKit, the
filesystem, or process launch is a small, boring, well-named Rust command; everything with
product opinion (grammar, matching, ranking, rendering) is TypeScript. If a change puts
product opinion in Rust or AppKit calls in TypeScript, it's in the wrong layer. Keep the IPC
command surface tiny and typed; adding a Tauri command is an architectural decision — record
it in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Invariants

1. **Zero required permissions.** The app runs with none (sole exception: the standard
   Automation consent prompt, and only if the effective terminal falls back to iTerm2 —
   Ghostty, the default, has no AppleScript dictionary and needs no consent). Nothing
   requiring Accessibility.
   One opt-in, off by default: Settings → General → "Use the launcharr loupe" makes
   `colorpicker` ask for **Screen Recording** once (2× magnifier, DECISIONS 2026-08-17);
   off — and until granted — it's Apple's `NSColorSampler`, which needs nothing. Nothing
   ever prompts unless that toggle is flipped.
2. **Network is allowed; telemetry is not.** The desktop app may talk to the network
   wherever a feature needs it (retired the zero-network invariant, DECISIONS
   2026-09-04). Fetches are fail-visible, cached, and off the hot path. What stays
   banned: analytics, crash reporting, update pings, any request that exists to tell
   someone about the user rather than to serve them. Credentials the app uses are the
   user's own (the CLIs' stores, the Keychain), read with consent where a provider's
   settings say so, never written or refreshed by launcharr.
3. **Tiny IPC surface.** A handful of typed Tauri commands; every command is a future
   plugin-API liability.
4. **Prefix dispatch is general.** `!` is mode dispatch via first-char lookup, not a special
   case — scripts join the same grammar.
5. **The matcher stays pure.** Fuzzy matching/ranking are I/O-free functions in
   `packages/core`; both apps consume the same implementation — never fork or hand-copy it.
6. **Focus discipline is sacred.** Summon never steals focus irrecoverably; Esc restores it
   exactly. Proven in M0 before anything was built on top.
7. **The site is fully static.** `output: 'export'` in `apps/www` — no API routes, no
   middleware, no server runtime.
8. **Design tokens only** in `apps/www`: page colors come from the CSS vars in
   `src/app/globals.css`, and shadcn/ui's semantic tokens are _mapped onto_ those vars,
   never imported (DECISIONS 2026-08-16). Exception: the demo renders a dark macOS desktop
   in both site themes, like a screenshot — but its panel and bar chrome are driven by the
   app's own theme tokens (`@launcharr/tui/themes`), not hand-typed hex, so the theme
   picker retints them exactly as the app does. Page-level design source of truth is the
   Claude Design project "Launcharr landing page design"
   (`02b1ac80-4556-43d7-810b-b5938cc2573e`) — visual changes round-trip through it, but it
   never overrides invariant 10 for anything depicting the app.
9. **Release facts are generated, not authored.** `apps/www/src/lib/release.json` is written
   by `scripts/release.sh` — never hand-edit it. `site.ts` derives version, artifact URLs,
   and install methods from it; site copy is free, release data is not.
10. **The website never holds a second copy of launcharr UI.** Every pixel `apps/www`
    renders of the app — panels, rows, the bar, agent cells, cards, themes, keyboard
    behaviour — is **imported from a shared package** (`packages/tui`, `packages/core`).
    Not ported, not mirrored, not "kept in sync": imported. If a surface the site needs
    lives only in `apps/desktop`, the fix is to **extract it into a package first**, then
    import it — never to retype it with a comment pointing at the original. Copying is not
    a shortcut to be justified; it is the failure. Never invent a component, and never
    build one from a design mockup: a mockup is a proposal, the app is the fact, and
    mockups go stale within hours (proven 2026-08-16, DECISIONS). Only genuinely absent
    **data** is fictional — a fake index, fake OS readings — and it is shaped like the
    real payload. **The demo being the actual app is the site's whole novelty; a replica
    that drifts is worse than no demo at all**, because it ships a confident lie that
    stays invisible until someone who knows the app looks at it. This scales the wrong way
    with complexity: every new surface doubles the copies, and each one drifts silently.
    Generalises invariant 5 from the matcher to the entire UI.

## Performance budgets (requirements, not aspirations)

| Metric                                     | Budget                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Hotkey → panel visible and accepting input | **< 100 ms** (target 50)   |
| Keystroke → updated results on screen      | **< 16 ms** (one frame)    |
| Enter → launch initiated + panel dismissed | **< 50 ms** launcharr-side |
| Idle memory (resident, panel hidden)       | **< 120 MB** ceiling       |
| Cold start → hotkey registered             | **< 1 s**                  |
| Full index rebuild (~300 apps)             | **< 500 ms**               |

A budget miss cuts or flags the offending feature. Changes touching summon, matching, or
launch paths must not regress these — measure before claiming; record numbers in the plan
file or JOURNAL. No UI animation on the hot path (keystroke → results). The matcher and
ranking are the highest-value test targets in the repo — exhaustive Vitest coverage,
property-style cases welcome.

## Rust standards

Same spirit as the TypeScript rules: strict, minimal, boring.

- Stable Rust, pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`. `cargo fmt` with default rustfmt settings.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` must pass (it's part of `pnpm verify`). No
  `#[allow]` without a one-line comment saying why.
- No `unwrap()`/`expect()` outside tests. The only exception is a truly infallible case, with
  a comment proving it (`// infallible: regex is a literal`).
- Errors: `thiserror` for typed errors inside modules; Tauri command boundaries map errors to
  a serializable error type for the frontend. Never stringly-typed errors across IPC.
- `unsafe` (and raw `objc2`/AppKit bindings) live in dedicated, small modules with a safety
  comment per block — never inline in command handlers.
- Tauri commands are thin: validate input, call a plain function, map the result. Logic lives
  in plain functions so it's testable without a Tauri runtime.
- Types crossing IPC derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize` and have a mirrored TypeScript type;
  keep the pair adjacent in naming (`AppItem` ↔ `AppItem`).
- TDD applies to Rust wherever the code is testable in-process (index parsing, frecency SQL,
  config parsing). Native AppKit behavior (panel focus, activation, AppleScript hand-off)
  is verified manually against a written checklist in the task's plan file; quirks go to
  `docs/JOURNAL.md`.
- Every crate is a liability: prefer std, keep the tree shallow. `cargo audit` at release
  milestones.

## Commands

| Command                                      | What                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                                   | All apps in parallel (desktop panel needs `pnpm --filter @launcharr/desktop tauri dev`) |
| `pnpm --filter @launcharr/desktop tauri dev` | The app, for real (Tauri shell + panel)                                                 |
| `pnpm --filter @launcharr/www dev`           | The site                                                                                |
| `pnpm verify`                                | The gate: typecheck + lint + format + test + cargo test + clippy                        |
| `scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z`                   | The only way to release (see `docs/RELEASING.md`)                                       |

## Definition of done

- `pnpm verify` green (typecheck, lint, format:check, Vitest, cargo test, clippy `-D warnings`).
- New pure logic (matcher, ranking, grammar) has unit tests written first.
- Performance budgets not regressed.
- `docs/STATUS.md` (and the task's plan file) updated in the same commit; pushed, CI green.
