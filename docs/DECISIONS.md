### 2026-09-11 · Theme policy: pure TS resolves, Rust reports inputs, a manual pick sticks, `system` mode owns light/dark

- **Decision.** _Which_ theme is active is a policy layered on top of the theme rung,
  and Omarchy has no such layer. `@scuttlarr/core/appearance` is pure: a policy
  (`mode: system | light | dark | schedule`, `schedule {light, dark}` clock times, a
  `pair {light, dark}`, `focus: Record<modeId, theme | pair>`) plus inputs (active
  macOS Focus id, system appearance, wall clock) → one theme name. Resolution: a
  mapping for the active Focus wins, else the pair; mode picks the half. Rust
  (`appearance.rs`) only reports inputs, both permission-free: it watches
  `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/` (Assertions.json = active Focus,
  ModeConfigurations.json = names) and `~/Library/Preferences/` (`AppleInterfaceStyle`
  via `defaults read` on change, never on a timer) and emits `appearance-input`. The
  panel window — the one that lives all session — runs `useAppearancePolicy`: on any
  input, policy edit, or schedule boundary it resolves and, only if different, writes
  `config.theme`. Everything downstream (windows, borders, the "everywhere" fan-out)
  already follows a theme change, so the engine has exactly one side effect. A manual
  pick (Settings select, `theme ⏎`) goes through `withPick`, which writes the slot the
  policy is currently reading (the pair's light or dark half, or the active Focus's
  mapping), so it sticks instead of being undone at the next input. Focus mappings
  are keyed by mode _identifier_, which survives a rename in System Settings.
- **`system` vs "follow it with macOS".** When `mode = system` macOS is the source of
  light/dark (its own sunrise/sunset schedule included) and the rung must not flip the
  OS appearance back, or the two would chase each other; `flipsMacos` is
  `macos && mode !== 'system'`. Our `schedule` exists for people who keep the OS
  feature off.
- **Why not in Rust.** Product opinion belongs in TypeScript (AGENTS); the policy is
  a dozen pure functions with tests, and Rust would have had to learn the config's
  policy shape (it stays `serde(flatten)` opaque). Why not a poll: two file watchers
  cost nothing idle; polling `defaults` is a process spawn per tick.
- **Deferred.** A global hotkey for the switcher (Omarchy's ⌥⌃⇧Space) — `theme ⏎` is
  the keyboard path for now, and custom shortcuts can already map a key to an item.
  Sunrise/sunset of our own: macOS does it; revisit only if `system` proves
  insufficient.

### 2026-09-11 · Theme format is Omarchy's `colors.toml`, verbatim; renders go to a state dir; terminals retint by OSC

- **Decision.** A theme is `themes/<name>/colors.toml` with Omarchy's keys unchanged
  (`mode`, `accent`, `selection`, `muted`, `background`/`dark_`/`darker_`/`lighter_`,
  `foreground`/`dark_`/`light_`/`bright_`, the eight named colours and their `bright_*`),
  plus an optional `[launcher]` table pinning any of our twelve UI tokens. Derivation
  (mixes, luminance → mode, aliases) matches `omarchy-theme-color` so an Omarchy theme
  ports by copying one file. Everything else is rendered from templates by
  `packages/theme` (pure TS: tiny TOML subset parser, `{{ key }}` / `{{ key_rgb }}` /
  `{{ mix a b N% }}`); `@scuttlarr/tui`'s built-in tokens are **generated** from those
  files (`themes.generated.ts`, stale-checked by `pnpm verify:themes`), never hand-typed
  again. Renders live under `~/.local/state/scuttlarr/current/theme/`, staged and
  atomically swapped, with `theme.name` beside them; base configs shipped by setup
  import from that path (Ghostty `config-file`, tmux `source-file`, zsh sources the p10k
  colours). Running terminals retint through OSC 10/11/12/17/19/4 written into every
  tmux pane plus SIGWINCH, exactly Omarchy's `omarchy-theme-set-tmux`; new Ghostty
  windows read the config file. Ghostty's own reload is **not** on the default path.
- **Why.** Omarchy converged on this after two format rewrites (hand-written per-app
  files → templates, 2.x → 3.4) and its theme catalogue is the largest one that exists
  for this shape; matching the keys buys every one of them for free and keeps
  "hackable" honest (a theme is one text file). Generating the tui tokens closes the
  last hand-copy of colours in the repo (invariant 10's spirit). OSC over reload: Ghostty
  1.3.1 on macOS reloads config only from its own keybind or, new in 1.3, AppleScript
  (`perform action "reload_config"` — the sdef now exists, JOURNAL 2026-09-11), and
  AppleScript means an Automation consent prompt (invariant 1). OSC needs nothing and
  reaches every pane under tmux/herdr, which is where scuttlarr users live; a bare
  Ghostty window without tmux retints on its next open. The AppleScript reload can be
  offered as an opt-in later, the same way the loupe is.
- **Also.** `~/.config/scuttlarr/themes/<name>/` overlays a same-named built-in
  file-by-file (Omarchy's `cp -r` order), which is where Dracula Pro and other paid
  themes live — never in the repo (scuttlarr invariant 8 carries over).

### 2026-09-11 · launcharr and scuttlarr fold into one product, named scuttlarr; the launcher is a feature

- **Decision.** The two repos become one: this monorepo absorbs scuttlarr and is renamed
  **scuttlarr**. The runtime-vs-provisioning boundary between them is retired as a _repo_
  boundary and kept only as _package_ boundaries: `apps/desktop` (runtime — bar, launcher,
  panels, settings, live reloads, theme policy), `packages/theme` (new — the Omarchy model:
  `themes/<name>/colors.toml` + templates + a pure renderer + committed per-app renders;
  `@launcharr/tui` tokens derive from it), `packages/setup` (new — scuttlarr's zsh `lib/`,
  `defaults/`, tests, ported as-is: install, defaults, Brewfile, shell, Caps→Hyper, duti,
  migrations, remove, the manifest). Product shape: **install gets the bar and launcher;
  everything else is a toggle** — desktop (tiling, borders), theme (rendered beyond our own
  windows: Ghostty, tmux, prompt, macOS accent/appearance, wallpaper; policy for macOS
  Focus and light/dark by system or schedule), machine (de-shine defaults, shell,
  Caps→Hyper, default apps, Brewfile — asks once with a plan). Plan:
  `plans/active/2026-09-11-unify-into-scuttlarr.md`; rename first, port second, build third.
- **Why.** Every runtime feature that touched the machine — bar, tiling, borders, dark
  mode, and now theme switching — drifted to whichever side was resident, and the
  "scuttlarr contract" (2026-08-25) kept being renegotiated instead of built; progress on
  themes hit zero. scuttlarr was a CLI with no interface, so "scuttlarr owns themes" only
  ever meant "owns the files"; a switcher, Focus reactions, and time-of-day are runtime
  acts and need the resident process. Omarchy has no such split: one name, the shell is
  just another themed surface. The name follows the product: this is a desktop
  environment, and "launcharr" undersells it the moment the bar is what people see.
  Mitch, 2026-09-11: sunk cost in the launcharr name, tap, bundle id, and domain is
  irrelevant; it never gets cheaper than pre-1.0 with one user.
- **Retired by this.** ROADMAP "scuttlarr contract" (its items become plan steps: light
  mode → 3.7, typed `desktop` → 3.3, dark-mode delegation → 4.4); the PRD non-goals
  "theming beyond the built-in look" and the AGENTS.md line "anything distro-shaped".
  scuttlarr's DECISIONS 2026-08-25 (boundary) and 2026-08-28 (launcharr handshake) are
  superseded — no handshake is needed between two packages in one repo; whoever renders
  a file still marks it, but the marker is one product's.
- **New invariant (AGENTS.md).** A path outside our own config has exactly one owner,
  recorded in a manifest; adopt moves, never overwrites. This was scuttlarr's
  ARCHITECTURE rule; it now governs app-side writes too (`aerospace.toml`, borders, the
  Claude hook entries, theme renders). `TomlState`'s adopt-or-leave is the existing
  instance, not a special case.
- **Alternatives.** (a) Keep two repos, scuttlarr a thin installer depending on launcharr
  — rejected, it _is_ the boundary that stalled work. (b) Fold under the launcharr name —
  rejected on product grounds above. (c) Rename last — rejected: every migration,
  decision, and file written in between would carry the wrong name.

### 2026-09-04 · Ghostty is the default terminal, reached through its multiplexer (herdr/tmux), never AppleScript

- **Decision.** `Terminal::Ghostty` (`"Ghostty"` on the wire) is a new bang-mode/agent-jump
  target and the new default (`config.rs`), ahead of `iTerm2`/`Terminal`.
  `effective_terminal` falls back Ghostty → iTerm2 → Terminal.app when Ghostty isn't
  installed. Ghostty is never addressed directly — it has no AppleScript dictionary and no
  working `+new-window` on macOS (JOURNAL 2026-09-04), so `terminal.rs` picks a route in
  this order: (1) herdr's socket, if its default-session server is running — create+focus
  a tab, then `pane.send_text` + Enter; (2) the most recently active tmux client's
  session — `tmux new-window -t <session> "<cmd>; exec $SHELL -l"`; (3) `open -na Ghostty`
  when no Ghostty process exists yet (the first launch is the one case `-na` is safe); (4)
  otherwise raise Ghostty and copy the command to the pasteboard, failing visibly — there
  is genuinely no way in. `plan_ghostty` is this decision as a pure, fully unit-tested
  function; the executor around it is thin I/O.
- **Why.** scuttlarr's stack declares Ghostty its only terminal (DECISIONS 2026-08-25); the
  contract item was still unimplemented and Mitch's own config still pointed at iTerm2.
  Losing AppleScript access is a net win for invariant 1: the Automation consent prompt now
  only fires if Ghostty falls back to iTerm2, not on Ghostty's own default path.
- **Mechanics.** `config.rs` (`Terminal::Ghostty`, new default), `terminal.rs`
  (`GhosttyProbe`, `plan_ghostty`, `HandOff`, the executor, `effective_terminal`,
  `raise_tty`), `herdr.rs` (`running`, `ghostty_handoff` — `tab.create` / `pane.current` /
  `pane.send_text` / `pane.send_keys` over the socket, shapes read from the bundled schema
  rather than guessed), `plugins.rs` (`upgrade_in_terminal` breadcrumb). TS: `config.ts`
  union, `SettingsApp.tsx` picker (Ghostty first), `App.tsx` default, `HelpPanel.stories`,
  `apps/www` copy + demo. Plan: `plans/active/ghostty-handoff.md`.

### 2026-09-04 · Zero-network retired: the network is allowed, telemetry is not

- **Decision.** Invariant 2 no longer says "no network requests". The desktop app may use
  the network wherever a feature needs it — fail-visible, cached, off the hot path. The
  carve-out ledger (favicon 2026-08-09, usage limits 2026-08-16, widgets/plugins
  2026-08-15/27) is closed; those entries stand as history. What remains banned is
  telemetry in any form: analytics, crash reporting, update pings, anything whose purpose
  is reporting on the user. Credential rules are unchanged (the user's own stores, consent
  where a provider's settings say so, never written by launcharr).
- **Why.** Mitch, 2026-09-04: "This is no longer a goal. Many upcoming features will touch
  the network." The invariant had already been amended three times; the first feature of
  the day (app-update checks across brew/mas/pnpm/npm/mise) would have been a fourth.
  A rule with four exceptions is not a rule.
- **Mechanics.** AGENTS invariant 2 rewritten in place (numbering kept — invariant 10 is
  cited everywhere). DEVIATIONS row removed. README, PRD, ROADMAP, PLUGINS/WIDGETS/SCRIPTS
  docs and the site docs page reworded. JOURNAL/DECISIONS/plans-done untouched (append-only).

### 2026-08-28 · Boundary amendment: scuttlarr ships desktop files; the managed toggle is the handshake

- **Decision.** Amends 2026-08-25 ("scuttlarr never writes `aerospace.toml`"). scuttlarr
  ships `aerospace.toml` + borders defaults as plain files — its fallback when launcharr
  is off or absent. When "Let launcharr manage AeroSpace" is on (the default under
  scuttlarr), launcharr writes both, themed from its tokens, marked `# generated by
launcharr`; scuttlarr's theme/update/doctor skip files carrying that prefix, and
  launcharr keeps adopt-or-leave for foreign files. **Whoever manages, writes; the other
  never touches the file.** AeroSpace and JankyBorders stay one unit in launcharr.
- **Why.** For a launcharr-only user, tiling + borders + bar are one control surface;
  for a scuttlarr user, the desktop opinion must be a readable, overridable file like
  every other. The existing `TomlState` machinery is exactly the seam — nothing to
  build here; the contract is now written down on both sides
  (scuttlarr `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, DECISIONS 2026-08-28).

### 2026-08-28 · The Claude hook adapter lives at a stable path launcharr installs — never a checkout

- **Decision.** `hooks/claude-status.py` is compiled into the app (`include_str!`) and
  installed to **`~/.config/launcharr/hooks/claude-status.py`**; `hooks.rs` registers it
  for all ten events in every Claude config dir's `settings.json` (`~/.claude`,
  `~/.claude-*`). Two commands join the surface: `hooks_status`, `hooks_install`
  (Settings → Agents → Local monitoring). At every launch with monitoring on, launcharr
  keeps the installed file current and **repairs** registrations it recognises as its own
  (any command ending `/hooks/claude-status.{py,sh}`) that point elsewhere — it never
  adds one unasked. `serde_json` gains `preserve_order` so the user's file keeps its
  key order; first edit takes a one-time `settings.json.bak-launcharr`.
- **Why.** Hooks were hand-pointed at the git checkout; moving the repo to
  `stackarr/launcharr` broke all sixteen entries at once, and the bar just went quiet.
  A runtime that reads agent state must own the adapter that produces it. The stable
  path is also the file a distro (scuttlarr) can provision or point at — files on disk
  are the provisioning boundary agreed the same day.
- **Boot repair, not boot register.** Rewriting our own stale paths is what would have
  prevented the breakage and touches nothing that isn't ours; adding registrations to
  someone's Claude settings is a consent the settings button gives. Plan:
  `plans/done/hooks-owned-by-launcharr.md`.

### 2026-08-28 · Mirrored journals are a directory convention, pulled by a plugin

- **Decision.** The usage monitor also scans
  `~/.local/share/launcharr/mirrors/<host>/{codex,claude}/` — journals from other
  machines, merged into the Codex account and the default Claude account. What puts
  them there is not launcharr's business: the reference `mirror` plugin
  (`apps/desktop/plugins/mirror/`, tick mode, `rsync` over the user's own ssh every
  5 min, `*.jsonl` only, hidden cell while healthy) is one way; Syncthing or a cron is
  another. No `agents.mirrors` config knob.
- **Why.** Mitch's Codex use is mostly on the Mac Mini (beebee, running OpenClaw); the
  account limits were already account-wide, but the day/model histograms were local
  only. A convention keeps invariant 2 exactly where the widgets carve-out put it — the
  plugin's network, over the user's ssh, to the user's machine; launcharr reads files.
  One setting (`MIRROR_HOST`) instead of two places to configure the same fact.
- **Not decided.** Mirrors as their own accounts (they merge into the default one);
  pushing from the remote instead of pulling; Claude journals from a machine on a
  different subscription (they would land in the wrong account — label them, or don't
  mirror Claude from it).

### 2026-08-27 · Plugin host API: four calls, blob-loaded modules, native providers for bundled plugins

- **Decision.** Plugin UI (`cell.tsx`/`panel.tsx`) reaches the app through a `host` of
  exactly four calls — `open(target)`, `copy(text)`, `send(message)` (a JSON line on the
  service's stdin), `openPanel(id?)` — each one an existing or new IPC command
  (`script_action`, `plugin_send`, `open_panel`). No `invoke` from plugin code. New
  commands (invariant 3, recorded): `plugins_list`, `plugin_state`, `plugin_module`,
  `plugin_send`, `plugin_install`, `plugin_remove`, `plugin_restart`; `usage_status`
  retired (the usage plugin's state rides the snapshot). **Loading:** Rust runs
  `bun build --external react/@launcharr/tui/lucide-react` into
  `~/.config/launcharr/.build/<id>/`; the webview registers its own module namespaces
  under `globalThis.__launcharrShared`, generates a per-module ESM shim (`export const
useState = m.useState…`) as a blob: URL, rewrites the plugin's shared specifiers to
  those URLs, and `import()`s the plugin as a blob: URL. `builtAt` is the cache key, so
  an edit hot-swaps. **Bundled plugins** (`packages/plugins/`: usage, calendar) are
  Vite-bundled and take state from a Rust provider named by `manifest.native` — usage.rs
  stays Rust; `native` is refused in user plugins. Layout slot `plugin:<id>`; the old
  `usage` module id migrates in place.
- **Why.** One React instance is non-negotiable (hooks break across two) and a
  Vite-bundled app has no bare `react` to hand out; a custom URI scheme + import map
  would work but adds a protocol handler, CSP work, and an import map that must exist
  before any module loads. Blob URLs need none of it — plain ESM, provable with unit
  tests on the two pure halves (shim generation, specifier rewriting). Keeping usage.rs
  in Rust rather than rewriting 1,400 lines of journal scanning, keychain, and fetch into
  a Bun service: the plugin _contract_ is proven on the UI side (the same `cell.tsx`
  props third parties get) and on the service side by the reference plugin; churning a
  feature Mitch just built for purity would be regression for nothing.
- **Deviation from the plan.** Slice D said "service.ts (moved out of usage.rs)". Not
  done — see above; recorded in the plan.

### 2026-08-27 · Plugins are code: cells and panels as React on `@launcharr/tui`, service in Bun

- **Decision.** "Widgets are data, never code" (2026-08-19) is **superseded**. A plugin is
  a directory — `manifest.json` (+ `kinds`), optional `service.ts` (long-lived Bun process
  emitting JSON-line state events), optional `cell.tsx` / `panel.tsx` (React components
  importing only `@launcharr/tui` / `@launcharr/core`, receiving `{state, settings, host}`),
  `model.ts` for tested logic. No UI files = today's widget, unchanged; `tick` widgets are
  wrapped as services. Built with `bun build` on install, served over a `launcharr-plugin://`
  scheme, one shared React instance via import map. `host` is a tiny recorded IPC surface
  (`open`, `copy`, `send`, `openPanel`); no direct `invoke` from plugin code. **First-party
  panels become plugins** under `apps/desktop/plugins/` — usage first — so the API is
  dogfooded. Plan: `plans/active/plugins-react-cells-and-panels.md`.
- **Why.** The data-only card (title + dot-rows) is the ceiling every real panel hits —
  usage meters, a month grid, charts — so each becomes a hand-written first-party panel and
  a launcharr PR. Studying Omarchy Quattro: its plugins are UI files on a shared component
  library (`qs.Ui`) over a few OS primitives, and its first-party panels are plugins. We
  already run the equivalent stack (WKWebView + React + `@launcharr/tui`); only the rule was
  in the way, and Mitch called it overstated (2026-08-27). Invariant 10 _improves_: a plugin
  cell renders on launcharr.com from fixture state, which Omarchy's QML cannot.
- **Trade.** Plugins become code (Omarchy/Raycast/VS Code posture): a git URL installs
  something that runs. React/tui become a public API (semver + `schemaVersion`). Resident
  memory moves — measured before usage migrates (118 of 120 MB today).
- **Rejected.** A richer declarative layout JSON (a worse React with a schema we own
  forever); a second component system; per-cell iframes (cells must be cheap; revisit on a
  real need).

### 2026-08-27 · Omarchy plugins on macOS: rejected (a Quickshell backend, not a proxy)

- **Question.** Could launcharr run Omarchy Quattro plugins unmodified — 0 → many plugins
  overnight — rather than build its own?
- **Finding.** A Quattro plugin is `manifest.json` + QML (`BarWidget.qml`, `Panel.qml`,
  `Service.qml`) on **Quickshell** (Qt 6.6+, Linux/Wayland only, needs `qt6wayland` private
  headers) plus Omarchy's `qs.Ui` (32 components) / `qs.Commons`. Across ten community
  plugins the imports are QtQuick + `Quickshell` + `Quickshell.Io` + `qs.*` in 8/10;
  Hyprland/Mpris/Wayland in the rest; first-party ones lean on Pipewire, UPower, Polkit,
  Pam. Running them means **writing a macOS backend for Quickshell** (Wine, not a shim):
  ship Qt (~50 MB, a QML engine idling at 60–120 MB against a 120 MB whole-app budget),
  reimplement `PanelWindow`/`Process`/`FileView`/`IpcHandler` on Cocoa in a separate helper
  process (Qt and Tauri both want `NSApplication`), vendor `qs.Ui`, and chase a three-week-
  old, weekly-shipping target forever. ~8/10 community bar widgets would load, then shell
  out to `hyprctl`/`nmcli`/`omarchy-*`. Catalogue today is ~100–150 repos, mostly Linux
  system widgets and plugin managers; the data-driven remainder is what a small plugin
  covers. It also ends invariant 10 (QML can't render on the site).
- **Kept.** The _shape_ — manifest with `kinds`, plugin owns its UI on the shell's component
  library, first-party panels are plugins, `Model.js` logic testable outside the shell,
  `plugin add <git-url>`. See the entry above. A launcharr plugin may import an Omarchy
  plugin's `Model.js` directly; the reverse (an Omarchy plugin hosting launcharr's JSON
  widget contract) is cheap if ever wanted.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude accounts are a directory convention; usage rides the bar push

- **Decision.** The usage monitor treats every Claude Code config dir as one account:
  `~/.claude` plus each `~/.claude-*` (how `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` users split a second
  subscription). Identity comes from that dir's `.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`; credentials
  from `<dir>/.credentials.json`, else the keychain item Claude Code derives from the path
  (`Claude Code-credentials-<sha256(dir)[..8]>`, bare for the default dir). No account
  config — `agents.claudeAccounts` only renames or hides. One consent toggle (`claudeCreds`)
  covers all Claude accounts. The bar gets a `usage` cell fed by a `UsageBarState` fold on
  the 1 Hz `BarSnapshot` (no new poll, no new command); the panel moved into
  `@launcharr/tui` so the site renders the real one. One new IPC command, `open_panel(id)`:
  the bar's click-through summons the launcher straight into a panel tenant.
- **Why.** Discovery-by-convention keeps the zero-config promise and matches how the CLI
  actually stores state — inventing an account registry would drift from it. Deriving the
  keychain service name means the second account works the day it's logged in, with no
  launcharr-side setup. Riding the bar push keeps the refresh cadence single-owner (the 60 s
  report cache) and makes the cell the reason the cache stays warm while the panel is closed.
  `open_panel` is the first bar → panel path; `panel-shown` still resets the prompt first, so
  the tenant opens exactly as its trigger word would.
- **Alternatives.** Per-account cells (rejected: minimal is the theme — one meter, the
  tightest window, hover for the rest); a `security-framework` keychain read (rejected: the
  `/usr/bin/security` CLI is what makes macOS show its own consent prompt).

### 2026-08-26 · Liveness comes from the process; tmux only ever adds evidence

- **Decision.** `reap()` consults the pid before it acts on a missing pane. A pane found in the
  layout is still proof of life and still short-circuits (no `ps` sweep for a fleet whose panes
  all turn up); what changes is the reaping direction — a pane _absent_ from even a trusted
  layout no longer reaps a session whose pid is alive and whose `comm` still matches. Only a
  pid-less session, or one whose process is gone or recycled, can be reaped that way. Alongside
  it, `trusted_layout()` demotes a successful-but-empty `list-panes` read to untrusted and
  refuses to cache it.
- **Why.** A pane list is a second-hand report about someone else's process tree, and it fails
  in a way that reads as "the entire fleet died" (JOURNAL 2026-08-26: one empty read emptied
  the bar until the app was restarted). The process table is the thing actually being asked
  about. This also makes the failure _shaped right_: a launcharr that can't read tmux now loses
  pane grouping and jump targets — visible, annoying, honest — instead of silently deleting
  agents that are running.
- **What it costs.** A pane that genuinely closed while its agent process lives on keeps its
  cell (pane-less, so no group border and no jump). That is the trade the module's own comments
  already argue for: a ghost cell is an annoyance, a vanished live agent is a lie. And a fleet
  whose panes stop resolving now pays one cached `ps -Ao` sweep per 2 s — far under budget.
- **Alternatives.** Pid-first ordering outright: rejected because it flips the 2026-08-18 rule
  that a live pane outranks a missing process, and it spends a sweep on every tick in the
  all-tmux case. Trusting an empty layout after N consecutive empties: more machinery, same
  answer, and the honest reading of zero panes on a running server is "the read is broken".

### 2026-08-25 · scuttlarr is the distro; launcharr is the runtime — the contract, and what it costs us

- **Decision.** The "anything distro-shaped" non-goal gets a name: it's
  [scuttlarr](https://github.com/mitchmalone/scuttlarr), a sibling project. launcharr is the
  runtime (launcher, bar, panels, widgets, agent cells, AeroSpace/borders config generation);
  scuttlarr is provisioning and state (install, defaults, packages, theme source of truth,
  keyboard, default apps, shell, terminal, wallpaper, migrations). **The only interface is
  `~/.config/launcharr/config.json`** — scuttlarr renders a theme into `themes.<name>` +
  `theme`, and desktop opinions into `desktop`. scuttlarr never writes `aerospace.toml` or
  borders config; launcharr never writes outside its own config and generated files.
- **What it costs launcharr.** Four items, now on the roadmap: (1) **light mode stops being a
  non-goal** — scuttlarr ships Solarized Light as a first-class theme, and the token model
  already supports it; the non-goal was about not designing a second look, not about refusing
  a palette. (2) A **Ghostty** terminal hand-off target beside iTerm2/Terminal.app. (3) The
  `desktop` config block becomes a **typed, documented schema** — today it's
  `serde_json::Value`, which would make scuttlarr couple to internals. (4) The **dark mode**
  system command **delegates to `scuttlarr theme`** when the CLI is on PATH, else does the
  naive flip — so appearance and palette can't diverge.
- **Duplication that's fine.** Both can `brew install` AeroSpace/borders. scuttlarr installs
  first; `deps.rs` is detection-first, so launcharr just sees them present.
- **Trigger for "theming beyond the built-in look".** It was "a second user exists" — scuttlarr
  is that user. The theme tokens become a contract (documented in `packages/tui` `./themes`).

### 2026-08-20 · Widgets piggyback CLI credentials first, and say so: `requires` + `setup`

- **Decision.** The primary credential story returns to piggybacking the provider CLI's
  own login (`gh auth token`, the Vercel CLI store) — the CLI keeps it fresh, the user
  already has it. Two contract additions make it fail-visible instead of silently blank:
  manifest **`requires`** (`[{label, fix}]` — static prerequisites, fix copyable) and
  tick **`setup`** (`{message, fix}` — the widget can't run until the user acts: dim
  cell, message + copyable fix in the hover card and the settings row). `setup` replaces
  `hidden` for missing/stale credentials; `hidden` stays for "nothing to say". Pasted
  Keychain tokens remain as the override; in Settings, a widget's fields and prereq lines
  render **only while it needs attention** (or to manage a stored token) — a healthy row
  is just its name and "ok". The OAuth `auth` machinery ships dormant: github-actions
  offers the sign-in button only once a launcharr OAuth App client id is baked in (none
  is registered yet).
- **Why.** Mitch's target UX is add → click → approve → data with zero credential
  fetching; one-click OAuth is blocked on registering an app per provider (a browser
  step only Mitch can do), and the first cut leaked plumbing — client-id and repo-list
  fields, "far too much for a user", and permanent token inputs that read as a token
  form even when optional. CLI piggyback delivers zero-setup for the common case; its
  failure mode (Vercel CLI 58's short-lived tokens, JOURNAL 2026-08-19) is answered by
  `setup` — alerted with the fix — instead of 2026-08-16's silent `hidden`.

### 2026-08-19 · Widget settings: declared in the manifest, kept by launcharr, delivered as env; OAuth is the widget's (try-out)

- **Decision.** A widget manifest may declare `settings: [{key, label, hint?, secret?,
required?}]` and `auth: {label}`. launcharr renders the fields in Settings → Menubar →
  Custom widgets, stores **secrets in the macOS Keychain** (`security-framework`; service
  `launcharr`, account `widget/<id>/<KEY>`; never to a webview, never in config.json) and
  **plain values in `config.widgets[id]`**, and sets each declared key as an **env var**
  on every `tick`/`auth`. A widget with an unset `required` setting is not run — it shows
  "needs setup" (dim cell, keys named) instead of a red one. `auth` is the widget's own
  flow: launcharr runs `<widget> auth`, reads JSON lines (`{url,code}` → shown with an
  open button, `{message}`, `{settings:{KEY:v}}` → stored, secrets only), exit 0 = signed
  in → tick. Four new IPC commands: `widget_secret_set`, `widget_secret_keys`,
  `widget_auth`, `widget_auth_cancel` (invariant 3: recorded). Reference widgets:
  `vercel.ts` = stored token (`VERCEL_TOKEN`, CLI fallback), `github-actions.ts` = OAuth
  device flow against launcharr's own OAuth App (client id baked into the widget; one
  row: sign in _or_ paste a token — the first cut's client-id + repo-list fields were
  rejected on sight as "far too much for a user", Mitch 2026-08-19).
- **Why.** The "credentials the provider CLI already stores" rule (2026-08-16) broke on
  Vercel CLI 58's short-lived tokens (JOURNAL 2026-08-19), and it never matched how a
  user installs a widget — they expect to paste a token or sign in. Declaring needs in
  the manifest keeps widgets data-not-code; env delivery keeps the widget contract a
  child process; Keychain keeps secrets out of dotfiles. OAuth stays widget-owned so
  provider quirks and product opinion stay in TypeScript and launcharr is a store + env
  injector — invariant 2 holds (launcharr still makes no requests; the widget does,
  opt-in, as before). `security-framework` over `/usr/bin/security` because argv leaks
  the secret to `ps`. **Explicitly a try-out** (Mitch, 2026-08-19): built in a worktree
  to judge on use; not a commitment to the final shape.
- **Not decided.** Cross-widget shared secrets (namespaced per widget for now), a
  launcharr-hosted OAuth app, refresh tokens (the widget re-auths), non-secret auth results.

### 2026-08-19 · Bar colours are theme tokens only; "fine" is fg, `warn` joins the theme

- **Decision.** Every colour on the strip resolves to a theme token — no more literal
  greens/blues/reds in `bar.css`. The theme grows one token, **`warn`** (each built-in
  seeds it from its `bang`), and the panel-kind var set now ships `--warn` and `--danger`
  (the bar is a panel-kind window; before this `--danger` only reached settings, and the
  bar's red was the CSS fallback). Mapping: **agents** working → `accent`, attention /
  blocked → `danger` (still breathing), done / idle / unknown → `fg`. **Widgets** `ok` →
  `fg`, `warn` → `warn`, `error` → `danger`, `muted` → `dim`, `accent` → `accent`.
  **Battery** charging / good → `fg`, low → `warn`, critical → `danger`. **Awake** off →
  `dim`, armed → `fg`. **Wifi** offline → `danger`, poor (1 bar, below −80 dBm) → `warn`,
  otherwise `fg` (`wifiTone` in format.ts). `apps/www` drops its two hand-added
  `--danger` overrides since the kit's `themeVars` carries it.
- **Why.** Mitch: the icons were "all over the place" — a green idle agent beside a blue
  done one beside a blue `ok` widget beside a green battery. Rule now: **if everything is
  `fg`, life is good**; colour is spent only on "busy" (accent) and "needs you" (warn /
  danger), and it retints with the theme like everything else. Custom themes that
  predate `warn` fall through to the built-in they overlay, so nothing blanks.
- **Trade.** A charging battery below 90 % is now visually the same as a healthy one
  (same tier glyph, both `fg`); the card still says charging. Revisit by showing the
  bolt glyph whenever on power if that reads as a loss.

### 2026-08-19 · Plugins are TypeScript, run under Bun — never Python

- **Decision.** Bundled scripts, reference widgets, and any example plugin launcharr ships
  are **TypeScript**. A `.ts`/`.js` file in `~/.config/launcharr/{scripts,widgets}/`
  needs no shebang and no `chmod`: `runtime.rs` runs it under **Bun** (PATH → Homebrew →
  `~/.bun`), falling back to Node (PATH → Homebrew → Volta/fnm/nvm, newest first; Node
  ≥ 22.6 strips types), located once per process because a Finder-launched app has a
  bare PATH. Neither found → the widget cell goes red with `needs bun — brew install
oven-sh/bun/bun`; a script is skipped with a log line. Any executable in any language
  still works — TS is the paved road, not a fence. The Python bundle (`ip.py`,
  `json-format.py`) is retired on sight (`*.py.retired`, mode 644, edits preserved) and
  replaced by `ip.ts`, `json-format.ts`; the four widgets were rewritten in TS with their
  pure `view()` halves under Vitest and shared types from `@launcharr/tui/bar/types`.
- **Why.** Mitch, on seeing `.py` reference widgets: "we've clearly tried to use
  TypeScript wherever possible… TypeScript is far more universal for the user." The
  reference set sets the culture; TS plugins share the repo's types and its gate. Runtime
  paths weighed: user-shebang (dies on Finder's bare PATH), bundling Bun (~60 MB, kills
  "lightweight"), build-to-executable (kills "edit it in place, it's live"); resolving
  the user's own Bun/Node in ~40 lines of Rust keeps both values. Bun first because it
  runs `.ts` natively and starts in ~10 ms — negligible tick latency.

### 2026-08-19 · Bar widgets are the scripts protocol pointed at the bar — data-driven, never code

- **Decision.** User-built bar cells ("widgets", the ROADMAP's Module API) are executables
  in `~/.config/launcharr/widgets/` answering `manifest` / `tick` with JSON — the same
  contract philosophy as `docs/SCRIPTS.md`, full text in `docs/WIDGETS.md`. A tick emits
  **data only** (lucide icon name, short label, a tone from a fixed set, a click action,
  a card of dot-rows); one generic `BarWidgetCell`/`BarWidgetCard` in `@launcharr/tui`
  renders every widget. No widget-supplied HTML/JS/React, ever. Rust (`widgets.rs`) runs
  ticks on their own threads with a hard timeout, keeps the last view per widget, and
  ships them in `BarSnapshot.widgets`; failures keep the last view and paint the cell
  `error` with the reason (fail-visible). Refresh: interval, `triggers/widget.<id>`,
  or any change to the dir (live add/edit/remove). Widgets join `bar.layout` as
  `widget:<id>`. Network + secrets are the widget's own business (2026-08-15 stands);
  a credentialed widget without its credential answers `{"hidden": true}` — no cell, no
  request (2026-08-16 stands, generalised). Cell/row clicks reuse `script_action`.
  **Three commands added** for Settings → Menubar → Custom widgets (same day, after
  Mitch asked where install/uninstall lived): `widget_install` (a picked file's bytes,
  or a URL — one user-initiated download, the favicon carve-out; the file must answer
  `manifest` or it is removed again), `widget_remove` (registry-known files inside the
  widgets dir only), `widget_tick` (= touching the trigger file). Settings reads the
  live widget set from `bar_snapshot` so the zone board can place them.
- **Why.** Data-driven keeps invariant 10 free (the site renders the same widget from a
  fixture), keeps third-party code out of the webview, and keeps every widget wearing
  the theme; the four retired Sketchybar modules (uptime, GitHub Actions, Vercel, TRMNL)
  all fit the shape exactly, so it was proven by porting them (`apps/desktop/widgets/`).
  Rejected: widget-owned rendering (a second UI copy per widget, invariant 10's exact
  failure mode) and a static manifest file (an executable that prints one is strictly
  more hackable and matches scripts). Icons come from lucide by name via
  `lucide-react/dynamic` — ~1,700 tiny chunks in the bundle, only the used ones load;
  custom SVG icons wait for a real need.

### 2026-08-19 · The strip is glyph-only: information lives in the hover, not the bar

- **Decision.** Bar cells carry a glyph and a colour, nothing else, unless a value is an
  alarm (battery < 10 % prints its number; wifi offline prints "Offline"). Today that
  retired three always-visible strings: the wifi SSID (the glyph is now a four-arc
  strength indicator from `CWWiFiClient rssiValue`, no permission), the awake
  elapsed/remaining timer, and the battery percentage (lucide tier + colour from the
  **adjusted charge** — the macOS charge limit read from
  `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.powerd.charging.plist` counts as full; blue while
  charging, green ≥ 50 %, amber below, red < 10 %). Every retired value moved into the
  cell's hover card, where the true numbers stay (real %, "limit 80 %", "−66 dBm · good").
- **Why.** "Minimal is the theme" (2026-08-17, workspace app icons rejected on sight) is
  the bar's standing rule, and each of these strings was requested away as clutter within
  hours of being looked at. Colour and glyph carry the state a glance needs; the number is
  a hover away.
- **How to apply.** New bar modules ship glyph-first; a string in the strip needs an alarm
  to justify it. Rich detail is card-side by default.

### 2026-08-19 · A keep-awake hold survives quit/relaunch — persisted at arm, resumed under rules

- **Decision.** `power.rs` mirrors the armed session to `~/.local/state/launcharr/awake.json`
  when it is armed and removes it on any release; `resume()` at launch re-arms it if it
  still makes sense: a deadline only while still ahead; a condition hold always (the TS
  evaluator releases it on its first tick if the condition already fails); `manual` only
  within 12 h of arming; never across a reboot (`kern.boottime` stamped). Rust peeks at the
  spec exactly once (`until.kind == "manual"`) — the spec's meaning stays TypeScript's. A
  resumed hold toasts and the panel says "since relaunch". No helper process: assertions
  stay per-process and crash-safe.
- **Why.** Every rebuild-and-`ditto` (and any quit) silently dropped the running timer.
  Persisting at quit would miss exactly the paths that lose it (kill, crash, reinstall over
  the running app). Proved the same day: an "until agents idle" hold armed 13:06 resumed
  13:11 across a relaunch.

### 2026-08-18 · herdr is a second agent _store_, not a second hook source; the monitor goes multiplexer-agnostic

- **Decision.** launcharr reads [herdr](https://herdr.dev) directly over its unix socket
  (`~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`, newline-JSON) — `session.snapshot` on a 1 s cache, mapped
  into the same `AgentSession` the bar already renders, `agent.focus` to jump. herdr agents
  are **never persisted**: herdr owns them, so they're read live or not at all. The store's
  tmux-shaped fields became multiplexer-agnostic (`mux`, `muxTarget`, `muxGroup`, `muxIndex`,
  `muxLabel`; tmux session/window ↔ herdr workspace/tab), with `serde(alias)` so existing
  state files load. The adapter wire protocol is untouched.
- **Why.** herdr classifies agents itself — `working | blocked | done | idle | unknown`, our
  own vocabulary — so a hook-based integration would duplicate work herdr has already done,
  and only for the two agents that have hook systems. Reading herdr's snapshot covers
  everything it detects (cursor, opencode, grok, droid…) and makes liveness exact: in the
  snapshot means alive, absent means gone. No pane heuristics, no pid fingerprints.
- **Polling, not `events.subscribe`.** herdr's `pane.agent_status_changed` subscription
  requires a `pane_id`, so there's no session-wide status push; a subscriber would have to
  re-subscribe per pane as panes come and go. One `session.snapshot` per second — the same
  cache shape as `tmux_layout()` — buys the same freshness for a fraction of the machinery.
- **One pane, one cell.** Claude inside a herdr pane fires our hook _and_ is seen by herdr.
  The hook now detects `HERDR_PANE_ID` and calls herdr's `pane.report_metadata` with the
  user's prompt instead of emitting to launcharr — enriching the record herdr already owns
  (and herdr's own sidebar) rather than competing with it. `report_metadata` is
  presentation-only by design, so state stays herdr's and the two cannot disagree.
- **Ages.** herdr's snapshot carries no timestamps, only `state_change_seq`. launcharr
  remembers when each seq was first seen, so "3 m ago" means the same thing it does for
  hook-fed agents instead of resetting on every poll. First sighting counts as now — we
  can't know how long herdr has felt this way, and inventing an age would be a lie on the card.

### 2026-08-18 · Agent liveness is observed, not reported: pane + process reaping, `agent_forget` as the escape hatch

- **Decision.** The agent store stops trusting agents to announce their own death. `list()`
  now reaps: a session whose tmux pane is missing from a **successful** `list-panes` read is
  gone, and a pane-less session is checked against the agent **pid** its adapter reports —
  dead when the process is gone or when that pid now runs a different command. The pid's
  command is recorded at first sight and compared thereafter, never matched against a known
  agent name, so a new adapter (herdr, …) needs no reaper change. One new wire field
  (`pid`, optional, blank-inherits like `tmux`; `pidComm` is store-side only), one new
  command — **`agent_forget`**,
  bound to `⌫`/`x` in `agents ⏎`. The hook resolves the agent pid up the parent chain
  (`LAUNCHARR_AGENT_PID` overrides) and now ignores `SessionEnd reason=clear`.
- **Why.** Removal had exactly one path — a `SessionEnd` hook event — so any agent that died
  without getting to speak (closed window, killed pane, crash) haunted the bar for the full
  12 h prune window. Field case: a session quit 30 min earlier, pane-less, ungrouped,
  unjumpable, undismissable. launcharr already re-read the pane layout every tick and
  _noticed_ the pane was gone — it just nulled the location and kept the cell.
- **Direction of error.** Every rule errs towards keeping a session: a failed tmux read reaps
  nothing at all (tmux absent or cold start must never clear a live fleet), a live pane
  outranks a missing process, and a session with no pid rides the prune window as before. A
  ghost cell is an annoyance; a vanished live agent is a lie.
- **Amended same day.** The first cut kept anything it couldn't check, which left the very
  record that prompted this — no pane, no pid — sitting on the bar exactly as before, with
  hand-dismissal as the only cure. Corrected: a session with **nothing to interrogate** is
  judged on silence and held to 15 minutes, not the 12 h sweep. `pruneHours` is a bulk
  sweep, not a liveness test. A session that still claims a pane keeps the full window —
  a tmux read we couldn't make is ignorance, not death.
- **Alternatives.** `kill(pid, 0)` alone — cheaper, but a recycled pid pins a ghost forever.
  Shortening `pruneHours` for _all_ pane-less sessions — wrong about any agent that simply
  thinks for a long time; with a pid we can know instead of guess, so the short window is
  the last resort, not the first.

### 2026-08-17 · The launcharr loupe (2×, Screen Recording opt-in) fronts the color picker; the system sampler stays as fallback

- **Decision.** Same-day feedback: Apple's sampler zooms too hard to aim ("decrease
  intensity… try a zoom of 2") and exposes no magnification knob, so `colorpicker` now
  opens **our own loupe** (`loupe.rs` + `src/loupe/`): a transparent non-activating key
  panel over the mouse's screen; the webview draws a 264pt magnifier (default **8×**, 2–8 in
  Settings) from pixels Rust captures with `CGDisplayCreateImageForRect` — the loupe
  window's `sharingType = None` keeps it out of the frame (JOURNAL 2026-08-17 for the
  window-list attempt that skipped Notion), shows the centre pixel's hex, click picks / Esc cancels / losing key cancels.
  Two IPC commands: `loupe_capture(x, y, size)` (binary `Response`: `[w][h][RGBA…]`) and
  `loupe_done(hex?)`. It needs **Screen Recording**: not granted → `CGRequestScreenCapture
Access` once and Apple's `NSColorSampler` handles that pick, so nothing is lost by
  refusing. Invariant 1 reworded to "zero _required_ permissions" with this one opt-in.
  Zoom/diameter are constants in `src/loupe/main.tsx` (hackable), not config — yet.
- **Why.** The magnification is the whole complaint and only a loupe we draw can change it;
  drawing it in the webview keeps the opinion (zoom, ring, label) in TypeScript and Rust to
  byte-moving. The window is created once and hidden after (destroying nspanel-converted
  windows aborts, JOURNAL 2026-08-16), so idle memory only grows after the first pick.

### 2026-08-17 · Unfocused JankyBorders ring: a solid mid tone (border→fg 57%), not translucent dim

- **Decision.** `inactiveBorderColor` in `@launcharr/core/desktop`: opaque, 57% of the
  way from the theme's `border` to its `fg` (#8083a0 for launcharr). `BorderColors`
  now carries `border` + `fg` instead of `dim`; `INACTIVE_ALPHA` is gone.
- **Why.** With `gaps` fixed to mean the visible gap, the _unfocused_ pair still read
  as ~10px: the ring straddles the frame and a translucent dim ring reads as air, so
  the eye adds it to the gap. Tried live via `borders inactive_color=…` (2026-08-17,
  no reload needed): dim@70/100% — no change; surface/border tones — vanish into a
  dark wallpaper; fg@35% — washed out; solid #9498b8 — visible; solid #7f83a0 — reads
  as edge, gap reads 8. Baked as a ratio so other themes get the same relationship.
  Hypothesis 3 (draw the ring inset so geometry ≡ appearance) stays the eventual fix,
  upstream in JankyBorders.

### 2026-08-17 · `gaps` is the gap you see: borders and the top bar are factored in

- **Decision.** `gapPlan` in `@launcharr/core/desktop` turns the one `gaps` knob into
  AeroSpace numbers: JankyBorders draws its border centred on the frame, so
  `inner = gaps + width`, `outer = gaps + ⌈width/2⌉` (borders off → raw). Top:
  AeroSpace lays out inside `visibleFrame`, which already excludes a _visible_ native
  menu bar and the notch band, so externals add launcharr's strip only when the native
  bar auto-hides (`_HIHideMenuBar`, read via `desktop_status.menuBarHidden` on every
  apply) — and just the overflow (30 − 24) if both show. Bar height comes from
  `BAR_STRIP_HEIGHT` in `@launcharr/tui/bar` (the renderer had 32, the bar is 30 —
  the stray 2px on top).
- **Why.** Mitch measured 4/6/8/7 with `gaps: 8` + 4px borders and asked for 8
  everywhere, borders or not, from whichever bar is present or from 0,0 with none.

### 2026-08-17 · Color picker = Apple's `NSColorSampler`; confirmations are an in-panel toast, never a notification

- **Decision.** `colorpicker` (a `launcharr:` index item, fuzzy-matchable) runs
  `NSColorSampler` — the system loupe — on the main thread; the pick lands as uppercase
  sRGB `#RRGGBB` on the pasteboard, Esc copies nothing. No new IPC command: it rides the
  existing `execute` arm (`colorpicker.rs`, block2 callback). Confirmation is a **toast**:
  a one-row "✓ Copied …" the panel shows for ~1.1 s and then hides itself. Two feeders:
  the frontend (`copy_text` gained an optional `keep_open` so the row can show first) and
  Rust `panel::flash(text)` (`toast` event + `show()` _without_ key, for actions that
  finish after the panel dismissed — the sampler).
- **Why.** The sampler needs zero permissions and zero pixels of our own (invariant 1 and
  the weight budget); a hand-rolled loupe would need Screen Recording. macOS notifications
  need a granted permission, so the toast primitive is the only confirmation channel that
  keeps invariant 1 — and it's reusable for every "copied" action. HEX only for now (the
  ticket's open questions: format + history stay open until real use asks).

### 2026-08-17 · `lorem` is a built-in (five volumes, semi-random); the bundled script retires

- **Decision.** `@launcharr/core/lorem`: rng-injectable generator (Title / 1 sentence /
  2 sentences / Paragraph / 2 paragraphs; the classic opening survives as a paragraph's
  first sentence, everything else is drawn from the vocabulary). Two steps: `lorem`
  shows one row, **Enter opens the volume menu** (Mitch's feedback the same day — the
  keyword confirms first), Enter again copies; generation happens at that Enter so every
  copy is a fresh draw, toast confirms. `lorem.py`
  leaves the bundle (`json-format.py`, `ip.py` remain the reference scripts).
- **Why.** The ticket wants a picker of volumes and non-repeating text; the built-in
  trigger wins precedence over scripts (like `clip`), so keeping the script would only
  shadow it. Site copy and docs examples that used `lorem` as _the_ script example now
  use a `uuid` example.

### 2026-08-17 · Agent mode surface lives in `@launcharr/tui` (`AskSurface`); markdown-lite in core

- **Decision.** The `?` conversation is turns (`AskTurn[]`); the **first question is
  pinned in the header** (`AskPinned`, spinner while busy), the transcript scrolls
  below (`AskSurface`), the follow-up prompt row sits at the bottom — moved there by
  flex `order`, so the `<input>` never re-mounts and keeps focus. Thinking state is a
  Claude-style breathing asterisk cycle + a shimmering rotating verb; streaming shows a
  pulsing block cursor. `parseMarkdownLite` moved from apps/desktop to
  `@launcharr/core/markdown`; the www demo imports the same components (invariant 10 —
  the demo's hand-rolled ask block is gone). Brand icons (GitHub, X) moved to
  `@launcharr/tui/icons` (own entry point: RSC-safe) for the same reason.
- **Why.** Notion "Agent Mode Feedback". Images in answers were **declined**: rendering
  remote images means the desktop app fetching over the network (invariant 2), and the
  caged CLI has no fetch tools anyway — needs an invariant discussion, not a ticket.

### 2026-08-17 · Settings: Agents split into sub-tabs; Shortcuts tab removed; About fleshed out

- **Decision.** Settings → Agents = SubTabs (Agent mode / Local monitoring / Usage
  monitoring). The Shortcuts tab is gone — `config.shortcuts` and its hot-apply are
  untouched (hand-edit config.json; may return as a panel). About: byline, links to
  launcharr.com / docs / GitHub / releases / X, the zero-permissions line.
- **Why.** Notion tickets ×3 (Mitch, 2026-08-17): the Agents tab had grown three
  features deep; per-item global hotkeys aren't earning their tab yet.

### 2026-08-17 · Unmanaged aerospace.toml: `desktop_toml` (use my own / save a copy), file dialogs via osascript

- **Decision.** Settings → Desktop → "Let launcharr manage AeroSpace". Checked: knobs, no
  file talk. Unchecked: a Config-file row with **edit**, **use my own config…** (pick any
  toml; the canonical `~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml` becomes a symlink to it, anything
  there first is `.bak-launcharr`'d) and **save a copy to edit…** (launcharr's rendered
  config written where you choose behind an "exported — yours now" first line, then linked
  to). One new command, `desktop_toml(action)`, returning the chosen path or null on
  cancel. Pickers are `osascript 'choose file' / 'choose file name'` — no dialog plugin
  crate. Re-managing renames a fresh file over the symlink; a user's target is never
  written through. `open_path` gained the `aerospace-toml` target for **edit**.
- **Why.** Mitch (0.4 feedback): the managed/unmanaged switch should be one plain sentence,
  and unchecking should hand you real options rather than prose about a path. Symlinking
  is how dotfiles users already work; the copy-out is the honest way to "start from
  launcharr's and make it mine". Also this round: borders ride on tiling (tiling off →
  borders off, section hidden), Always-float hidden, settings 760px wide, HTML DnD fixed
  (JOURNAL 2026-08-17).

### 2026-08-17 · Screenshots panel: three commands; the first grid + scrolling panel

- **Decision.** `ss ⏎` / `screenshots ⏎` opens a newest-first thumbnail grid of the
  macOS screenshot folder (`defaults read com.apple.screencapture location`, else
  `~/Desktop`); Enter puts the **file** (file URL + image bytes) on the pasteboard and
  hides — ⌘V into Claude/Cursor/a browser is the whole feature. ⌘⏎ reveals, ⌘⇧⏎ opens.
  Three new commands: `list_screenshots` (full listing, TS pages/filters),
  `screenshot_thumb` (320px JPEG cached under `$APPDATA/thumbs`, asset-protocol
  served, decodes serialised), `screenshot_action` (copy | open; reveal reuses
  `reveal_item`). Plan: plans/done/screenshots-panel.md.
- **Why.** @the_mewc: the one Raycast feature a "better Spotlight" user keeps it for —
  "purely as a means to get visual feedback into <insert agent surface here>". A
  screenshot is found by recency, not by name (`Screenshot 2026-08-17 at 11.53.23.png`),
  so the 8-row narrow-by-typing list is the wrong shape: this is deliberately the
  first **grid** and the first **scrolling** surface (24 per page, ↓ past the bottom or
  scrolling to the sentinel loads more). Panels already left the 8-row list behind
  (`clip`, `wifi`); this is a new tenant, not a list exception. Grid nav is a pure
  `nav/grid.ts` in `packages/tui` (+ `useGridNav`, `ThumbGrid`/`ThumbCell`), so the
  site can import it under invariant 10.
- **Rejected.** OCR/text search, a date query language, a recordings tab, drag-out —
  Raycast's surface area, not the need. `NSFilenamesPboardType` (deprecated; file URL
  - image data covers Finder, browsers and terminals).

### 2026-08-17 · v0.4 desktop layer: AeroSpace as a Homebrew dependency, JankyBorders opt-in, never vendored; corner radius via hidden default; CornerFix rejected

- **Decision (delivery).** AeroSpace ships as a **cask dependency** (`depends_on cask:
"nikitabobko/tap/aerospace"`), not a vendored binary — this supersedes the "vendor a
  pinned release binary under launcharr's own directory" clause of 2026-08-15. Zip installs
  get the same via a one-click `brew install` from Settings (or the command shown when
  Homebrew is absent). launcharr downloads nothing itself: zero-network holds.
- **Decision (borders).** JankyBorders is **GPL-3.0** (verified); AeroSpace MIT; launcharr
  MIT. Distributing the `borders` binary inside `launcharr.app` is GPL distribution (grey
  at best); porting its code makes launcharr a derivative (GPL — dealbreaker). Installing
  via Homebrew and spawning it as a process triggers neither. So: borders is an **opt-in
  Homebrew install from Settings → Desktop**, supervised by launcharr, never vendored,
  never ported. Its config is CLI flags rendered from launcharr's theme, no `bordersrc`.
  No MIT alternative exists that is maintained (yabai's pre-v6 border code is the only
  fork candidate; not worth owning a SkyLight hack).
- **Decision (config ownership).** launcharr's `config.json` is the only surface;
  `aerospace.toml` is generated from a pure renderer in `packages/core` and reloaded live.
  Few knobs (modifier, gaps, workspace count, float rules, border width, corner radius).
  `desktop.tiling.managed = false` is the escape hatch **and** the adopt-or-stop
  migration answer for existing installs (adopt = backup + overwrite).
- **Decision (corner radius).** System window corner radius is a look-and-feel knob via
  the hidden AppKit global `defaults write -g NSConvolutionOverride1 -float N` (no SIP,
  no injection; verified 2026-08-17 on 27.0 — `0` reads as unset, min 1; per-app on
  relaunch; Finder/Quick Look exceptions). Undocumented → the UI says so and fails
  visibly. **CornerFix** (makalin, MIT) and macos-corner-fix (m4rkw) are dylib-injection /
  SIP-off tools — rejected outright; incompatible with zero-permissions and with asking
  users to weaken system security for cosmetics.
- **Decision (Mitch's machine).** Hand-installed AeroSpace/borders/aerospace-swipe come
  off before installing 0.4; only launcharr-managed versions from then on. Dotfiles keep
  the toml/bordersrc as historical templates but stop deploying them.
- **Decision (AeroSpace's menu bar item).** Goal: fewer menu bar items, so hide it by
  default. **Not possible from outside**: it's a SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` without
  `isInserted`, so AppKit forces `NSStatusItem VisibleCC Item-0 = 1` back on every launch
  (tried 2026-08-17, both `Visible` and `VisibleCC` keys) and no config key exists. Instead
  the menu's _contents_ move into the launcher — **`aerospace ⏎` panel** (fuzzy `aero`,
  `tiling`, `workspace`): workspaces (Enter/digit focuses), pause/resume, reload config,
  open config, sponsor — so the icon is redundant and a menu-bar manager (Ice/Bartender)
  or launcharr's own bar covering the strip can hide it. Hiding it for real needs an
  upstream AeroSpace option (MIT — a small PR; not started).
- **New IPC** (thin, plain-function-backed): `desktop_status`, `desktop_apply`,
  `desktop_adopt`, `desktop_install`, `desktop_corner_radius`, plus `aerospace_workspaces`
  / `aerospace_action` (validated enum) for the panel. Plan:
  `plans/done/v0.4-desktop-aerospace-borders.md`.

### 2026-08-16 · awake B–D: sessions split Rust-mechanical / TS-opinionated; one readings command

- **Decision.** A keep-awake session's _semantics_ live in TypeScript: `@launcharr/core/awake`
  owns the spec type, grammar, every user-facing string, and the pure trigger reducer
  `(reading, prev) -> verdict`. Rust stores the spec **verbatim** (never interprets it) and
  enforces only the two mechanical rails — the absolute deadline and the battery floor — in a
  watchdog thread, so they fire with every webview asleep. One further IPC command joins the
  surface: `awake_readings(apps, display, net)` — a single sample (AC, battery, SSID, agent
  states, plus optionally running apps / external display / net bytes, each gathered only when
  the _caller_ asks). The caller decides the flags from the spec, keeping Rust opinion-free.
  `BarSnapshot` gains the cheap `awake` state.
- **Watcher placement.** The bar window evaluates triggers on each Rust-pushed snapshot while a
  conditional session is armed (zero cost idle); the launcher window runs a 10 s fallback
  interval only when the bar is off. Both may run — release is idempotent. Known degradation:
  with the bar off, the fallback rides WebKit timers, which throttle in hidden windows; the
  grace windows and Rust rails bound the damage.
- **Readings sources.** Load via libc `getloadavg`, displays via CGGetOnlineDisplayList /
  CGDisplayIsBuiltin, apps via NSWorkspace on the main thread (all in-process, permission-free);
  network via `netstat -ib` behind a 30 s cache, paid only while a busy session is armed. The
  busy trigger watches **processor and network** — disk I/O has no cheap permission-free
  cumulative counter, so the panel copy says exactly that (plan deviation, recorded there).

### 2026-08-16 · awake: in-process power assertions; three IPC commands; caffeinate slugs deleted

- **Decision.** Keep-awake (`awake ⏎`, plan `plans/active/awake.md`) holds
  `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` assertions **in-process** in `power.rs` — never by spawning
  `caffeinate`. Three Tauri commands join the surface (tiny-IPC rule): `awake_arm` /
  `awake_release` (sync, two IOKit calls) and `awake_status` (async; spawns
  `pmset -g assertions` for the "also keeping this Mac awake" list — panel/card open only,
  never the bar tick). The `caffeinate` and `decaffeinate` system-command slugs are deleted.
- **Why.** In-process assertions carry launcharr's name in `pmset -g assertions`, are
  introspectable, and release on drop/quit/crash (per-process kernel state — the OS reaps
  them with us). The deleted `decaffeinate` ran `pkill -x caffeinate`, killing **every**
  caffeinate on the machine including ones held by build scripts and agent sessions — a
  footgun, not a feature. Arming always pairs `PreventUserIdleSystemSleep` with
  `PreventSystemSleep`: the latter is what survives lid-close on AC and costs nothing on
  battery (macOS ignores it there by policy).
- **Grammar continuity.** The deleted slugs' aliases (`caffeine`, `caffeinate`,
  `keep-awake`) must resolve to the `awake` grammar when slice B lands, so muscle memory
  still works. `sleep` stays what it is — the existing sleep-now system command.

### 2026-08-16 · Invariant 10 hardened: imported, never ported — and the bar moves to the kit

- **Decision.** Mitch's call: **the website may never hold a second copy of any launcharr
  UI.** Invariant 10's original wording allowed "ported from the app source with the source
  named in a comment" — that escape hatch is closed. Every pixel `apps/www` renders of the
  app is imported from a shared package; if a surface lives only in `apps/desktop`, it gets
  extracted into a package _first_, then imported. Copying is not a shortcut to be
  justified; it is the failure.
- **Why.** The comment-and-port compromise was tested within hours and lost: the ported bar
  shipped four wrong facts (entry below). The deeper reason is scale — every new surface
  doubles the copies, and each one drifts silently. A rule that permits copying with
  paperwork is a rule that gets worse as the app grows.
- **Consequence, done same day.** The bar's presentational layer moved into
  `packages/tui/src/bar/` — `bar.css` from `.bar` down, the strip/workspace/agent/battery
  components, the pure formatters, and the data types. `apps/desktop/src/bar/main.tsx` is
  now a container (Rust snapshots in, `invoke` out) and `apps/www` imports the same
  components. Plan: `plans/done/bar-extraction.md`.
- **What deliberately did NOT move.** Zone resolution (`normalizeBarZones`/`notchedZones`
  encode config semantics including legacy migration — they belong beside `Config`),
  `window.__notched`, every `invoke`, and the bar _window's_ own CSS resets: a web page
  importing `height: 100%; overflow: hidden` on `<body>` would break. `BarModule`/`BarZones`
  _types_ did move, so there is one definition.
- **Hover stayed split, on purpose.** The app polls the cursor from Rust because WebKit
  won't deliver hover to a never-active accessory window; a browser has real pointer events.
  The kit defines `BarHoverApi` and each consumer owns its feed. A hook with an injected
  feed would be abstraction nobody needs yet.
- **Lucide became a kit dependency** rather than icons-as-props, and the battery icon-tier
  logic moved with it — otherwise both consumers would re-derive which glyph a percentage
  gets, which is the duplication being deleted.
- **Also.** `./bar` joins `./themes` as an entry point, for the same reason: server
  components must reach pure modules without pulling the React barrel.

### 2026-08-16 · Invariant 10: the site demos the real thing, never a replica

- **Decision.** Anything in `apps/www` depicting the app is **imported** from the shipping
  code (`packages/tui`, `packages/core`), or **ported from the app source with that source
  named in a comment**. Inventing a component, or building one from a design mockup, is now
  an invariant violation. Only genuinely absent data stays fictional — a fake index, fake OS
  readings — and it's shaped like the real payload. Full text in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Why (the incident).** The www redesign built its bar strip, agent cells and hover card
  from the Claude Design export's hardcoded values instead of `bar/bar.css` and
  `bar/main.tsx`. Mitch caught three errors on sight: the front app and right-side cells
  rendered `--dim` when `.bar-cell` says **"fg, not dim — the dim tone read too dark against
  the strip"**; the `working` cell used the site's pink `--cta` instead of the theme accent,
  so it didn't retint with the theme picker; and the hover card dropped the glyph and
  relative age, used the wrong tmux line, and sat at the wrong offset. The state key was
  `blocked` — that's only the display label; the wire name is `attention`.
- **The sharp edge.** All three facts were decided _that same day_. A design export is a
  snapshot of a proposal, and this app moves faster than any mockup can track — so a mockup
  is input to page layout and copy only, never to app-depicting components.
- **Why it's an invariant, not a preference.** The demo's entire value is that it _is_ the
  app: the matcher, the panels and the keyboard nav are really running. A replica that
  drifts is worse than no demo, because it ships a confident lie about the product and the
  drift stays invisible until someone who knows the app looks at it. This generalises
  invariant 5 (the matcher is never forked or hand-copied) from the engine to every surface.
- **Consequence.** A port is a debt, not a resting state: when a ported surface gains a
  second consumer, extract it into a package. The bar chrome is the live case — it sits in
  `apps/desktop/src/bar/` with the website now a second consumer, so extracting it into
  `packages/tui` is queued for Mitch's call.
- **Also.** `packages/tui` gains a `./themes` entry point (themes are pure data; server
  components can't import the barrel, which re-exports hook-using components), with the
  reason recorded in the package's exports map so a tidy-up doesn't fold it back in.

### 2026-08-16 · Zone board v2: full-width, and retirement replaces show/hide

- **Decision (layout).** The Menubar tab's zone boards deliberately break the settings
  window's 160px-label/control grid — three drag columns need the whole content column
  (`.row-full`). One-tab exception, not a new pattern.
- **Decision (retirement).** The per-module checkbox is gone: ✕ on a widget row retires
  it to a "Retired" tray under the board; tray chips drag back into any zone (or drag a
  widget straight onto the tray). Persistence is the existing `enabled: false` flag left
  in place — no schema change, and the bar renderer already skips disabled modules, so
  the concurrently-edited bar code needed no touches (coordinated with the battery
  session; boundaries held: this change is SettingsApp.tsx + settings.css only).

### 2026-08-16 · Battery hover card: one lazy command, and power mode stays read-only

- **Decision.** The bar's battery cell gets a hover card (capacity, time left, cycles, draw,
  health, active power mode), fed by a new `bar_battery_detail` command that spawns
  `ioreg -rn AppleSmartBattery` + `pmset -g custom` **on hover only**, never on the 1 Hz
  snapshot. The power-profile row is **read-only** — clicking the cell opens System
  Settings → Battery (a validated `open_path` target, not a new command).
- **Why.** The snapshot is pushed to every bar every second; hanging an `ioreg` spawn off it
  would buy a cost nobody sees most of the time — hence the fifth bar command, weighed
  against invariant 3 and taken. Setting power mode needs `pmset` as root, i.e. an admin
  prompt on every switch: invariant 1 (zero granted permissions) says macOS keeps that
  switch and we only report its position.
- **Also.** `bar_set_dropdown` now takes the height the open card needs (cards measure
  themselves), and the `window.__barMouse` hover machinery moved from `AgentCluster` into a
  shared `src/bar/hover.ts` — two hovering cells can't share one global by accident.

### 2026-08-16 · apps/www adopts shadcn/ui, and the site consumes `@launcharr/tui`

- **Decision (shadcn).** `apps/www` gains the shadcn/ui foundation — `components.json`,
  `cn()`, `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` + CVA — and copies components in under
  `src/components/ui/`. Its tokens are **mapped onto the existing launcharr CSS vars**,
  never imported: shadcn's oklch palette would fork the design tokens that invariant 8
  makes single-source. Radix is admitted only where it buys real keyboard a11y (Tabs);
  Button/Badge/Table are CVA-and-markup only, and the agent hover card stays hand-rolled
  because a Radix tooltip fights the fake-menubar aesthetic it lives inside.
- **Why.** The redesign adds a comparison table, tabbed install, and a docs route — the
  ordinary UI vocabulary the site has so far hand-rolled. shadcn is copy-in, so the
  components become repo code we own rather than a dependency that owns us, which is what
  keeps this compatible with "every dependency is a liability."
- **Decision (tui).** The site takes `@launcharr/tui` as a workspace dependency and renders
  the demo's wifi/dns/usage panels from the real kit. `src/lib/demo-themes.ts` — a
  hand-copied theme fork — is deleted in favour of the kit's `BUILTIN_THEMES`.
- **Why.** The fork had already drifted: it carried the retired `#ff176c` accent after the
  app reverted to `#ff6b8c`. The kit is pure presentation with React as its only peer dep,
  so there was never a reason for the website to own a second copy. Same spirit as
  invariant 5 — the site demos the real thing or it isn't a demo.
- **Cost.** The website now breaks if `@launcharr/tui` changes shape. Accepted: that break
  is a typecheck failure in `pnpm verify`, which is exactly the signal a drifted hand-copy
  never gave us.

### 2026-08-16 · Bar layout becomes explicit zones (left / center / right)

- **Decision.** The clock-anchored flat module list (same day, below) lasted hours:
  Mitch's verdict was that ordering alone can't express alignment. `bar.layout` is now
  `BarZones { left, center, right }` — every module lives in a zone, ordered within
  it, and the clock is an ordinary module. `bar.notchedLayout` is the same shape;
  notched displays render no center zone (camera housing), and when the field is
  absent the arrangement derives from `layout` with center folded into the head of
  right. Legacy `modules`/`notchedModules` migrate at load (split at the clock,
  exactly the old renderer's behavior) and stop being written.
- **UI.** Settings → Menubar is a zone board: one column per zone (three main, two
  notched), drag between and within columns, per-module show/hide. Missing modules
  normalize into their default zone; on notched boards center-homed modules fold
  into right so nothing becomes unreachable.

### 2026-08-16 · Notch profiles + arranger; bar disable hides, never destroys

- **Decision (notch).** Notch detection is automatic per display —
  `NSScreen.safeAreaInsets.top > 0` (notch.rs; safe objc2 API, no new crate, no
  permission). The bar gains an optional second arrangement `bar.notchedModules`
  (None → main `modules` applies everywhere); each bar window learns its profile via
  an initialization script (`window.__notched`). Under a notch the absolute center is
  the camera housing, so notched bars render the clock at the head of the right
  cluster instead of mid-strip.
- **Decision (arranger).** Settings → Menubar's up/down buttons are replaced by an
  HTML5 drag-to-reorder list with per-module show/hide, duplicated for the notched
  profile behind a "separate arrangement" checkbox (seeded from the main list).
  Module normalization now lives once in `lib/config.ts` (`normalizeBarModules`),
  shared by the bar renderer and settings.
- **Decision (crash fix).** `bar.enabled` off now _hides_ the bar panels;
  `window.destroy()` on the NSPanel subclass raised an ObjC exception that crossed
  tao's run-loop observer and aborted the process (crash report 2026-08-16 15:18,
  `__rust_foreign_exception`). Hidden panels idle — the push loop skips invisible
  windows — and re-enable shows them again. Cost: a toggled-off bar keeps its webview
  resident until restart; fresh installs with the bar off never create it.
- **Also.** The launcharr accent reverted to `#ff6b8c` (Mitch: `#FF176C` reads too
  red); the 2026-08-16 ground/fg/dim repaint stands. `tmux_layout` caches successes
  only, so a failed `list-panes` spawn at cold start no longer paints agent cells
  without their session borders for the first seconds.

### 2026-08-16 · Omarchy panel wave: audio + clipboard + help tenants, wifi scan, fuzzy keywords, 5-day ranking

- **Decision (IPC).** Five commands join the surface: `wifi_scan`, `audio_status`,
  `audio_set_volume`, `audio_set_muted`, `audio_set_default`; `wifi_connect` gains an
  optional password argument (validated like SSIDs — no leading dash, bounded length).
- **Decision (wifi scan without Location Services).** The P0 stance "scanning needs the
  Location opt-in" is reversed without spending a permission: `system_profiler
SPAirPortDataType -json` reports nearby SSIDs + security + signal with no TCC prompt.
  It takes ~7 s, so the command is async, one-shot per keypress, spinner in the panel.
  Joining an unknown secured network gets a masked password step (TextPrompt `secret`).
- **Decision (audio, no new crates).** Volumes ride `osascript` (`get/set volume`);
  device enumeration + default switching use the CoreAudio property API via ~5
  hand-declared FFI calls in `coreaudio.rs` (dedicated unsafe module, safety comment per
  block) rather than a binding crate. Permission-free on both paths. Volume applies to
  the default device — same behavior as the hardware volume keys.
- **Decision (clipboard panel).** `clipboard ⏎` opens a TwoPane tenant (search prompt,
  history left, full-text preview right) over the existing `clips` backend; `clip`
  inline rows stay. Text-only, like the store (PRD §5.6) — image capture is a separate
  weight decision, not taken here.
- **Decision (help panel).** `help ⏎` renders the command reference (modes, keys,
  panels, system commands, scripts — `ScriptInfo.description`'s first consumer,
  quicklinks). Panel metadata moved to `panels/registry.ts` (pure) so help and the
  keyword items read it without importing the app shell.
- **Decision (fuzzy keywords).** Panel trigger words become rankable `panel`-kind items
  (`usag` → Usage) through the same `rank()`; exact tokens still dispatch via the
  grammar, so invariant 4 stands.
- **Decision (ranking, Mitch).** The frecency signal becomes "launches in the past
  5 days" (1.0 in-window, 0.1 residual) and the multiplier cap moves 1.5 → 2.0 so a few
  days of launching VS Code beats Codex on `code`. This half-reopens the 2026-08-08
  acronym-vs-prefix worry (JOURNAL) — accepted deliberately: learned preference is now
  _supposed_ to override the default textual order; watched in daily use.
- **Also.** launcharr theme repainted (#1C1D2A / #FF176C / #B5B9D9 / #73747C, mirrored
  in www demo-themes); bar wifi + battery cells draw lucide-react icons (custom
  Lucide-style brand icons can join with the same `ICON_PROPS`).

### 2026-08-16 · `?` agent mode ported; `ask` joins the IPC surface; prefix keys become mode switches

- **Decision (IPC).** One command joins the surface: `ask(prompt, continue_conversation)`
  — spawns the user's own agent CLI (claude or codex per `agents.askProvider`) from a
  caged cwd and streams raw stdout lines to the frontend as `ask-chunk` events; parsing
  is TypeScript's job. Gated by `agents.askMode` (off by default), checked in the command
  itself as well as the UI. launcharr still makes zero network requests here — the
  user's CLI does, on their credentials (same family as the iTerm2 hand-off).
- **Decision (interaction).** Prefix keys (`!` `?` `:`) pressed on an empty prompt now
  switch mode and are consumed; Esc/Backspace return to search, mode keys hop directly.
  This adopts the spike-ask-ai branch's keystroke-switched model (initially skipped in
  the port, requested by Mitch the same day). Pasted prefixed text still parses through
  the grammar, so invariant 4's first-char dispatch remains the substrate.
- **Why.** The spike proved the streaming, caging (TCC inheritance — JOURNAL
  2026-08-10), and markdown surface in July; the panel-framework era made porting cheap.
  Codex support reuses the same spawner with `exec --json --sandbox read-only` +
  `resume --last` (verified against codex-cli 0.147); its cage is weaker than claude's
  (no per-tool disallow flag) — watched in daily use.

### 2026-08-16 · Limits credentials: consent capabilities, not source pickers

- **Decision.** The per-provider source _selects_ (same day, below) are replaced by
  boolean consent toggles — `agents.claudeCreds` / `agents.codexCreds`, "launcharr may
  read the CLI's stored credentials". Source selection and fallback order belong to the
  code: Claude tries the credentials file first (silent, expiry-checked) and the
  keychain second (macOS prompts; last so a denied prompt can't re-fire every scan);
  Codex tiers live fetch → last-good → this device's session snapshot. A `LAST_GOOD`
  cache serves stamped stale limits ("as of 14m ago — offline") through transient
  failures. A future own-sign-in capability can join as another boolean.
- **Why.** Discussed with Mitch 2026-08-16: users should grant capabilities and get the
  best available data, not pick implementation details (the file-vs-keychain choice
  already mispicked once — the file was 5 days stale). Own-OAuth was considered and
  deferred: it makes launcharr a token custodian for near-zero marginal reliability;
  the last-good cache buys most of the resilience for a fraction of the surface.

### 2026-08-16 · Account limits join the usage monitor: opt-in HTTPS, opt-in credentials (invariant 2 amended)

- **Decision.** The usage panel's primary question — "how soon am I limited?" — is
  answered by the providers' own endpoints (`api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`,
  `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`), because the windows are account-wide and
  server-computed; local journals can't see other devices (Mitch's openclaw boxes share
  the Codex account). Everything is opt-in in the new Settings → Agents tab: the usage
  monitor itself, then per-provider credential sources — Claude
  `off | credentialsFile (~/.claude/.credentials.json) | keychain (via /usr/bin/security,
macOS consent prompt)`, Codex `off | authFile (~/.codex/auth.json)`. **launcharr never
  refreshes or writes another app's tokens** — expired → a visible "run the CLI" note.
  Invariant 2 gains this as its second carve-out. Local monitoring also becomes opt-in
  (`agents.monitor`, prune window + show-idle options), and `bar.enabled` +
  `bar.modules` (ordered, clock as center anchor) are Settings-managed and hot-applied.
- **Why.** Mitch approved HTTPS for this use-case (2026-08-16); the alternative
  mechanisms CodexBar uses (browser-cookie decryption, PTY-scraping the claude TUI,
  token refresh with keychain rewrite races) are exactly what the invariants exist to
  keep out. Off-by-default keeps the fresh-install posture identical to before.

### 2026-08-16 · Usage monitor is local-only: journals, not APIs

- **Decision.** The `usage ⏎` token monitor (CodexBar-inspired) reads only the journals
  the agent CLIs already write — `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (per-message usage,
  deduped by message id across session forks) and `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
  (`token_count` totals + the local `rate_limits` snapshot). One command joins the IPC
  surface: `usage_status`, returning a cached report and kicking a background rescan
  when stale (per-file cache keyed by len+mtime; measured 110ms cold / 12ms warm over
  ~98MB).
- **Why.** CodexBar gets richer data via OAuth APIs and browser-cookie decryption — both
  unthinkable under invariants 1–2. The journals carry everything the panel needs, and
  local-only means the panel works offline and adds zero attack surface. Providers are
  data-driven; more can join without new architecture.

### 2026-08-16 · Agent monitoring absorbed: launcharr owns the agent-status socket

- **Decision.** launcharr replaces `sketchybar-agent-status` (Go daemon + sketchybar
  widgets). A Rust listener owns a unix socket at
  `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/launcharr/agents.sock` speaking that project's
  newline-JSON event protocol unchanged (`{session, agent, state, title, detail, tmux}`;
  `ended` deletes, blank fields inherit). Claude Code hooks emit via an in-repo adapter
  (`apps/desktop/hooks/claude-status.sh`); the Go launchd daemon is booted out (revert
  path in plans/agent-monitoring.md). Sessions idle >12 h are pruned — the old daemon
  accumulated forever.
- **Decision (IPC).** Two commands join the surface: `agents_status` (panel list) and
  `agent_jump` (tmux switch-client/select-window + `open -a` the configured terminal).
  The bar itself needs no new command — agents ride the existing pushed snapshot.
- **Why.** The bar replaced every other sketchybar module already; agent status was the
  last holdout, and its socket→state→push shape is exactly the bar's architecture. Keeping
  the wire protocol means any future adapter (Codex etc., B4) is just another emitter.
  The socket is local IPC, not network — invariant 2 holds.

### 2026-08-16 · Panel framework: trigger words open TUI panels; four wifi commands

- **Decision (framework).** Trigger words can now open full keyboard-driven TUI panels
  inside the launcher window (`wifi ⏎`): a `panelMode` state renders a tui-kit panel in
  place of the results list, the prompt collapses to a breadcrumb, Esc pops panel →
  prompt → dismiss. Panels are presentational components (workbench-storied, no tauri
  imports) plus a thin container owning invokes. JS timers are permitted in panel
  containers — panels exist only in the key window, which WebKit doesn't throttle
  (contrast: the bar, JOURNAL 2026-08-16).
- **Decision (IPC).** Four commands join the surface for the wifi panel: `wifi_status`,
  `wifi_known_networks`, `wifi_connect`, `wifi_set_power` — thin async wrappers over
  networksetup/ipconfig/route/scutil with tested parsers (wifi.rs). Permission-free by
  scope; network scanning (Location Services) deliberately excluded — trigger recorded
  in the plan.
- **Why.** Super+Space grows from launcher to control surface (P0/P1 on the ROADMAP);
  wifi first because it exercises list + live data + real actions + failure states.

### 2026-08-16 · First bar-module network carve-out: TRMNL device battery

- **Decision.** The TRMNL bar module polls `https://trmnl.com/api/devices` every 5
  minutes with the user's own API token — the first exercise of the per-module network
  renegotiation reserved in the 2026-08-15 entry. Scope is tight: the module is inert
  without a token (resolved via `TRMNL_API_KEY` or the age/secret decrypt helper the
  Sketchybar module used); no token → no cell, no request. Token present but API down →
  visible error state, never silent. Launcher core and every other bar module remain
  zero-network.
- **Why.** Parity with the retired Sketchybar setup; the module only exists because the
  user provisioned a credential for exactly this purpose — that provisioning is the
  consent. Vercel/GitHub/uptime modules (deliberately saved for later) will follow the
  same shape: credentialed, cadenced, fail-visible.

### 2026-08-15 · v0.5 direction: launcharr grows a menubar replacement — own bar, wrapped Aerospace, TUI kit

- **Decision (scope).** The next major version (jumping to 0.5) adds a **menubar
  replacement** and a **nicely wrapped Aerospace integration** to launcharr. This is
  launcharr evolving, not a new product and explicitly **not a distro**: menubar
  replacement + app launcher + config, wearing an Omarchy-inspired TUI-styled look.
  Anything distro-shaped (managing terminals, editors, dotfiles at large) is a non-goal.
- **Decision (build vs wrap the bar).** We build our own bar; we do **not** wrap
  Sketchybar. Rationale from the pressure test: launcharr already owns the hard window
  layer (tauri-nspanel, status-level non-activating windows, M0 focus discipline); we'd
  bypass Sketchybar's layout engine anyway (React on a character grid is the product);
  its popups can't render our rich TUI panels; and our Rust core has to gather all module
  data either way — the wrapper reduces to serializing our own data into `--set` calls
  against a vendored GPL binary, plus a permanent visual seam between an AppKit bar and
  webview popups. **Gate:** a memory spike must show acceptable resident cost for an
  always-visible webview bar before the bar milestone proceeds past spike stage.
- **Decision (Aerospace).** Wrapped, never rebuilt — it is irreplaceable behavior, not
  replaceable rendering. Ship an opinionated generated config, vendor a pinned release
  binary under launcharr's own directory (not via the user's Homebrew), supervise the
  process, integrate via CLI + `exec-on-workspace-change`. Aerospace's Unix socket stays
  off-limits (unofficial/unstable). Users never see Aerospace config; launcharr's config
  is the only surface. Existing-install coexistence needs an adopt-or-stop migration in
  the installer (not in this slice).
- **Decision (modularity).** Install-time and settings-time choice of any combination of:
  app launcher, menubar replacement, Aerospace integration. Launcher-only launcharr keeps
  working exactly as today.
- **Decision (TUI kit).** A complete TUI-like component library (`packages/tui`,
  Omarchy-inspired: charcoal panels, thin light borders, monospace two-column menus,
  keyboard-first) becomes the shared UI substrate for the bar, its panels, menus, and
  future mini-apps. Own components in the webview; never wrap a real terminal for chrome.
- **Invariants.** Zero-network and zero-permissions **hold for the core and for this
  slice** (bar spike needs only IOKit battery, the clock, and the Aerospace CLI). They
  will be renegotiated per-module when a module demands it (wifi SSID → Location Services,
  calendar → EventKit), as visible opt-ins — recorded then, not now.

### 2026-08-12 · One shared Homebrew tap for all projects — homebrew-launcharr retired

- **Decision.** launcharr's cask moves into `mitchmalone/homebrew-tap` (beside beeptui's
  formula); `mitchmalone/homebrew-launcharr` is archived. Install command becomes
  `brew install mitchmalone/tap/launcharr`. One tap per person scales to N projects with
  one satellite repo and one push credential (`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`, shared value, stored
  per app repo); per-project taps were an accident of history. Historical docs/release
  notes keep the old command — they record what was true at the time.

### 2026-08-11 · One monorepo per product (jig reconciliation) — supersedes the two-repo layout

- **Decision (topology).** The 2026-08-10 two-repo layout is dissolved: `launcharr-web` is
  absorbed as `apps/www` (snapshot import; history stays in the archived repo), the app
  lives at `apps/desktop`, and the shared engine is a workspace package `packages/core`.
  Per the jig standard: the sibling-repo arrangement duplicated tooling and forced
  hand-synced ports that a workspace package dissolves. The only external repo is the
  generated satellite tap. The umbrella dir and its CLAUDE.md are gone.
- **Decision (engine).** `@launcharr/core` (matcher, grammar, ranking, rows, emoji, math,
  url, types) is imported by both apps. The app's implementations are canonical — the web
  forks and the "port, don't fork" invariant are deleted. The website contains zero engine
  logic; its demo maps core rows to presentation only.
- **Decision (release split).** "The release IS a script" becomes "the release is the
  script + the tag workflow": local script keeps what physics demands (keychain signing,
  notarization, interactive smoke tests), pushes main, and `gh release create` mints the
  tag remotely — so the fan-out workflow (tap Cask bump, Notion version, mitchmalone.com
  deploy hook; each no-oping without its token) fires with the release already published.
  The release commit now carries `apps/www/src/lib/release.json`; CI fails the release if
  it disagrees with the tag rather than pushing corrections.
- **Absorbed from launcharr-web's DECISIONS.md** (dates preserved, file deleted with the
  repo): 2026-08-10 site consumes generated release.json (now invariant 9 in AGENTS.md);
  2026-08-09 CTA uses GitHub's button greens, not the design's accent green; 2026-08-09
  demo logic as tested pure modules (now subsumed by `packages/core`); 2026-08-09 static
  export, no server (now invariant 7); 2026-08-09 dark is the default theme; 2026-08-09
  Tailwind v4 utilities over inline styles.

### 2026-08-10 · Two-repo project layout + the release IS a script

- **Decision (layout).** The product is a parent dir (`~/Developer/mitch/launcharr`, not a
  repo) holding two sibling repos: `launcharr/` (this app — upstream for all release
  facts) and `launcharr-web/` (the site — consumes `src/lib/release.json`, generated,
  never hand-edited). Cross-repo rules live in the parent CLAUDE.md; one commit never
  spans repos.
- **Decision (determinism).** `scripts/release.sh` is the only way to release; if a step
  isn't in the script it isn't part of the release. Fail-fast preflight (clean trees both
  repos, notes-file-first, cert + notary profile present), all gates, bump, build
  (app + dmg targets), spctl-verified, checksummed, interactive gates for the two manual
  smoke tests (fresh-profile, upgrade-path), tag + GitHub Release, website data push
  (Vercel deploys), cask bump. Mitch's requirement: releasing must not be agent
  improvisation or memory — nothing forgettable.
- **Decision (install methods).** dmg (humans), zip (cask feed), Homebrew (advertised
  install + only update channel), build from source. No curl|sh installer — CLI idiom,
  second script to trust, brew already serves that crowd.

### 2026-08-10 · Release channel: sign with the personal Developer ID now; Homebrew tap is the installer and the updater

- **Decision (signing).** Releases are signed + notarized with Mitch's existing paid
  personal Apple Developer enrollment, starting with v0.3.0. The business account can come
  whenever; for direct-distributed macOS apps there's no signing continuity requirement —
  switching identity later costs one re-prompt of the single Automation consent (launcharr
  holds zero other permissions) and nothing else. Old releases stay notarized forever.
  Waiting for the business account would block releases for a purely cosmetic gain (the
  name on the ticket).
- **Decision (distribution + updates).** Install channel is a personal Homebrew tap
  (`mitchmalone/homebrew-launcharr`) pointing at the GitHub Release zip; build-from-source
  is the alternative. The advertised path is brew (curl'd artifacts carry no quarantine
  attribute, so even pre-signing builds run clean). **No in-app updater, ever, in this
  design**: tauri-plugin-updater phones home on a schedule, which violates the zero-network
  invariant; `brew upgrade` is the update story, on-brand for the audience. Never instruct
  users to strip quarantine (`xattr`/`--no-quarantine`).
- **Changelog.** Human-written release notes in the GitHub Release body ("what this
  version is"), `git log` as appendix. No CHANGELOG.md file until someone asks.

### 2026-08-10 · Reversal: home stays ~/.config/launcharr (XDG)

- **Decision.** The home-move below is reversed same-day, pre-release: launcharr's home is
  `~/.config/launcharr` after all. `migrate_home` now points the other way, so a dir at
  `~/.launcharr` (only Mitch's machine ever had one) moves back automatically. Everything
  else from that entry — settings Hackables buttons, `open_path`, slimmed tray, themes —
  stands.
- **Why.** Mitch's call on reflection: less clutter for the user. XDG is where this
  audience's dotfile tooling already looks; top-level home dirs are for platform tools
  with toolchains/caches (cargo, oh-my-zsh), and our scripts are user config in spirit,
  which `~/.config/launcharr/scripts` expresses fine.

### 2026-08-10 · Home moves to ~/.launcharr; config/scripts access lives in settings; themes land

- **Decision (home).** launcharr's home is `~/.launcharr` (config.json + scripts/), migrated
  from `~/.config/launcharr` by a one-shot tested `fs::rename` at startup (no-op when already
  moved or fresh). Data caches stay in Application Support. Tray drops "Open config"/"Open
  scripts folder"; settings ▸ General ▸ Hackables gains "edit config.json" and "open scripts
  folder" buttons via one new validated-enum IPC command, `open_path` (config|scripts) —
  recorded here per the tiny-IPC invariant.
- **Decision (themes).** A theme is a flat map of the CSS tokens both windows already use
  (bg, surface, glass, border, fg, dim, accent, sigil, bang, selected, danger). Built-ins
  `launcharr` (brand blue/pink — now the panel's look too), `dracula`, `terminal`
  (matrix black/green) live in `src/lib/themes.ts`; `config.theme` selects; `config.themes`
  holds user themes as partial overrides (may also override a built-in by name). No new IPC:
  themes ride the existing config watcher and hot-apply everywhere. Unknown names fall back
  to `launcharr` so a hand-edit can't blank the UI.
- **Why.** Mitch wants config at `~/.launcharr` and settings as the single gateway (tray
  stays lean); themes were the natural next step after the brand-color pass, and doing them
  as config-resident JSON keeps the hackable value — your theme is a text edit, not a plugin.

### 2026-08-10 · Settings goes native-structured: autosave, toolbar tabs, hidden titlebar, hotkey recorder

- **Decision.** The settings window keeps the terminal skin but adopts native macOS settings
  structure (Raycast as the reference): no Save button — every edit autosaves debounced
  (~400ms) and hot-applies via the existing watcher; toolbar-style tabs with Lucide icons
  (new dep `lucide-react`, tree-shaken); `TitleBarStyle::Overlay` + hidden title, tab strip
  is the drag region; hotkeys and custom shortcuts are recorded by keypress
  (`HotkeyRecorder` over pure `acceleratorFromEvent`), not typed as strings. Green is
  reserved for the sigil glyph; interactive accents are the blue.
- **Why.** The v0.2.0 form read as a web page: stacked labels, bordered cards, fixed footer
  with a green Save button, free-text accelerator fields. The web-page tells were structural
  (Save button, full-width inputs, top-labels), not the terminal identity — so we fixed the
  structure and kept the skin. Autosave was nearly free: the config watcher already
  hot-applied everything.
- **Mechanics.** Echo guard: our own `write_config` fires `config-changed`; the window skips
  events matching the last-written JSON so a stale round-trip can't clobber in-flight edits.
  Recorder derives tokens from `event.code` (layout-independent); global-hotkey's
  `parse_key` accepts friendly aliases ("S", "3", "Space", "Up") — verified against crate
  source, format unchanged from hand-written configs.

### 2026-08-09 · Network carve-out: user-initiated favicon fetch at quicklink-add time

- **Decision.** The add-quicklink flow fetches the site's favicon (apple-touch-icon and
  sized icons preferred; favicon.ico as explicit last resort, per Mitch). This is the only
  network launcharr core may touch: one-shot, user-initiated, at add time. No background
  fetches, no refresh jobs, no telemetry — the zero-network invariant otherwise stands.
- **Why.** Quicklinks without icons look broken next to apps; Mitch asked for detection with
  quality preference. A user pressing "Add quicklink" is consenting to exactly one fetch of
  exactly that site.
- **Mechanics.** ureq (4s/6s timeouts, 512KB HTML / 2MB icon caps), pure tested `<link rel>`
  scanner, cached as `link-<hash>.png` beside app icons. Browser choice stored per link
  (`open -a`).

### 2026-08-09 · launcharr gets a menubar icon (accessory policy stays)

- **Decision.** A single NSStatusItem with a template pirate-flag icon (⌘ cut-out) and a
  minimal menu: summon, open config, open scripts folder, reindex, quit. Requested by Mitch
  as the gateway for settings and future surface area. The original "menu-bar-less" PRD line
  is revised; accessory policy (no Dock icon) is unchanged.
- **Why.** Discoverability and a mouse-reachable escape hatch (if the hotkey ever breaks,
  the app is otherwise invisible). Guardrail: the tray must never grow features the prompt
  can't reach — the panel stays the product.
- **Mechanics.** Icon generated from `design/menubar-icon-source.png` by
  `cargo run --example make_tray_icon` (threshold → crop → 44×44 template PNG).

### 2026-08-08 · v1.1: scripts-first Sol parity; invariants hold; three features deferred

- **Decision.** Sol feature-matching lands as v1.1 by pulling the v2 script protocol forward:
  bundled, user-editable scripts (lorem, JSON-format, local IP) + built-ins only where scripts
  can't reach (inline math on the hot path, clipboard watcher, custom links/shortcuts from
  config). **Zero-network and zero-permissions stand** (Mitch, 2026-08-08): Google Translate,
  public IP, and Calendar (EventKit consent) are deferred, not built; clipboard is
  copy-on-Enter only — auto-paste would need Accessibility, which stays banned.
- **Why scripts-first.** Hackability is the differentiator; every feature built as a script is
  both a feature and living documentation of the plugin surface. Built-ins would Raycast-ify
  the codebase and make the v2 protocol a second-class retrofit.
- **Deferred triggers.** Translate/public-IP: if zero-network is ever relaxed, as opt-in
  config. Calendar: if the permission stance softens to "consent-gated, Accessibility still
  banned."

### 2026-08-08 · Repo conventions: pnpm + Lefthook (and a global AGENTS.md change)

- **Decision.** launcharr uses pnpm and Lefthook (pre-commit format/lint on staged files,
  commit-msg commitlint, pre-push tests incl. `cargo test`). This settled PRD open question
  §11.4 and updated the _global_ AGENTS.md at the same time — npm→pnpm and Husky→Lefthook are
  now the standard everywhere, matching emberstash in practice.
- **Why.** The global file said npm+Husky while real projects had moved to pnpm+lefthook; docs
  that disagree with practice are worse than either choice. pnpm's speed/strictness and
  Lefthook's single-binary, YAML-config model won on merits and on incumbency.

### 2026-08-08 · Docs system: adopt the emberstash structure wholesale

- **Decision.** `CLAUDE.md` (stable rules) + `docs/` (STATUS/ROADMAP/JOURNAL/DECISIONS/plans
  with `_TEMPLATE.md → active/ → done/`), docs shipping in the same commit as code. Plus the
  globally-required `AGENTS.md` (project deltas, incl. Rust standards) and `LEARNINGS.md`.
- **Why.** Proven on emberstash; session continuity for agent-driven development depends on it.
  JOURNAL/LEARNINGS overlap resolved by role: JOURNAL is the dated raw log, LEARNINGS the
  pruned per-topic reference — single source of truth per fact, promote don't duplicate.

### 2026-08-08 · Stack: Tauri 2 + tauri-nspanel + TS/React UI, matching in TypeScript

- **Decision.** Tauri 2 (Rust) shell with the community tauri-nspanel plugin for the
  non-activating floating panel; React/TS in the system WKWebView for all UI; fuzzy matching
  and frecency ranking in pure TypeScript in the frontend; Rust owns indexing, FSEvents, icon
  cache, launch, and the AppleScript hand-off; SQLite via rusqlite. (PRD §6.)
- **Why.** The panel/focus problem is the hard native part and tauri-nspanel exists precisely
  for it (Sol/SuperCmd as references). TS matching keeps the product-opinion layer hackable —
  the long-term differentiator — and the index is a few hundred items, so Rust-speed matching
  is premature. The architecture isolates the matcher so it _can_ move to Rust if the 16 ms
  keystroke budget fails (risk R2).
- **Alternatives.** Pure AppKit/Swift (fastest, least hackable, slowest to build); Electron
  (weight budget dead on arrival). Revisit only if M0's exit criterion fails.

### 2026-08-08 · System Settings panes: static curated table, not enumeration

- **Decision.** A versioned, hand-curated table of pane names → `x-apple.systempreferences:`
  deep-link IDs for the current macOS version. (PRD §5.1, risk R4.)
- **Why.** Programmatic enumeration of panes is unreliable and the IDs are undocumented. A
  broken pane link is low-severity; a curated table is greppable and fixable in one line.

### 2026-09-10 · Updates: upgrades run in the panel; the terminal is the fallback

- **Decision.** `↵`/`a` in `updates ⏎` run the source's upgrade command inside the app
  (`updates::upgrade`: `/bin/sh -c`, the checks' environment, stdin closed, output tail on the
  report, `x` cancels). `t` keeps the terminal hand-off. npm is dropped as a source.
- **Why.** The terminal hand-off failed invisibly twice over (bare PATH, wrong tmux session)
  and even when it works the user has to go find the window. A run the panel can watch is
  the honest UI. stdin closed means anything needing a tty (a sudo'ing cask) fails fast with
  a visible exit line and the `t` hint rather than hanging a background process. Not a PTY:
  interactive prompts are the terminal's job, and the weight budget says no to a second
  terminal emulator.
- **Alternatives.** Fix only the hand-off (done too — bang mode needed it); a PTY in the
  panel (rejected, above).

### 2026-09-10 · Bluetooth usage string in the bundle, for plugins — still zero granted permissions

- **Decision.** `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Info.plist` carries `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`.
  launcharr's own code never opens CoreBluetooth; the string exists so a plugin's service
  (a Bun child of launcharr.app, which macOS holds responsible) can. First user: the
  `amaran` plugin in `~/.config/launcharr/plugins/`, a Swift GATT bridge + a TypeScript
  Bluetooth Mesh stack driving a studio light with no vendor app.
- **Why.** TCC attributes a child process to the responsible app and, when that app's
  Info.plist lacks the usage string, kills the child outright — no prompt, no `.unauthorized`
  state, only a DiagnosticReports entry (proven 2026-09-10, `ble-helper-*.ips`). Invariant 1
  holds: nothing prompts until a plugin actually opens the radio, and the prompt names it.
  Same shape as the loupe's Screen Recording opt-in.
- **Alternatives.** A Rust Bluetooth command (product opinion for one plugin in core —
  rejected, invariant 3); the plugin bundling its own `.app` for the helper (a second
  responsible process to sign, notarise, and explain — rejected).

### 2026-09-10 · Plugins declare permissions; launcharr asks first, blocks on denial, never dies silently

- **Decision.** `manifest.permissions` names the privacy classes a service touches
  (`bluetooth`, `camera`, `microphone`, `location`, `contacts`, `calendars`, `reminders`,
  `photos`, `local-network`). `src-tauri/Info.plist` ships a usage string for every one of
  them. `permissions.rs` (raw `msg_send!` in one place, one framework per class) reads the
  bundle's own plist and TCC, **requests** at service start whatever macOS has not decided,
  and the supervisor treats a denied class — or a bundle missing the string — like an unset
  required setting: the service does not run, the cell dims, Settings → Plugins shows
  "uses: Bluetooth · denied" with a button (`plugin_permission_fix`: ask, or open the
  Privacy pane). A service the OS kills by signal reports `service killed (SIGABRT) — see
DiagnosticReports` and waits the full backoff instead of thrashing. One new command.
- **Why.** The first hardware plugin was killed on start with nothing but a crash file to
  explain it (JOURNAL 2026-09-10). Plugins will want all kinds of permissions; the app
  must recover gracefully rather than fail per class (Mitch, 2026-09-10). A usage string
  can only live in the bundle at build time, so "recover" means: the bundle is never the
  reason, the ask happens at a predictable moment in launcharr's name, and a denial is a
  visible state with a fix — not a restart loop. Invariant 1 holds: strings prompt nothing
  until code uses the API, and only a plugin the user installed does.
- **Alternatives.** Prompt lazily on first use (rejected: the prompt lands mid-service
  with a helper half-started, and a denial looks like a crash); ship only the strings
  plugins currently need (rejected: every new class would need a release before a plugin
  could exist); a Rust command per device class (rejected, invariant 3 — the helper
  pattern keeps hardware out of core).

### 2026-09-16 · The ranking corpus, naming roles, an enforced pure layer, off-means-off, no alerts, memory numbers

- **Decision (ranking corpus).** `packages/core/src/corpus.json` is a dense index shaped
  like the real payload — the apps of a working Mac with their derived keywords, every
  settings pane, the system commands, links, panel triggers, scuttlarr's own rows — plus
  cases pinning the row that must come first for a query, cold or warm. **A ranking
  complaint is a new case first**; the scorer moves second and every earlier case is
  re-checked at once. First run found five (JOURNAL).
- **Decision (naming roles).** Every string an item can be found by has one of three
  roles: the _name_ (shown, factor 1), a curated _alias_ (`preferences`, factor 0.9), or a
  derived _keyword_ (bundle id tail, `CFBundleName`, executable — factor 0.8, and it only
  counts contiguously at a word start). Ranking is keyed on role and match strength, never
  on which field supplied the text. `IndexItem.keywords` is optional across IPC so plugins
  and the site's demo index need nothing. Derivation lives once in `indexer::keywords_for`
  and is mirrored by the corpus generator.
- **Decision (pure layer, enforced).** Invariant 5 is now an ESLint failure: nothing in
  `packages/core/src` may import Tauri, React, Node I/O or the kit, or touch `window`,
  `fetch`, timers and friends. A lint rule is the cheapest mechanical guard TypeScript offers and
  runs in `pnpm verify`.
- **Decision (memory numbers).** `scripts/mem.sh` prints resident memory of the app and
  its helpers; the definition of done asks for before/after idle numbers on any change that
  adds a process, window, watcher or cache. First reading (JOURNAL) is over budget.
- **Decision (invariants 12 and 13).** Off means off; no native alerts. Both were already
  the practice; now they are written down so a future toggle that merely hides, or a
  `display dialog` for a yes/no, is a reviewable violation.
- **Alternatives.** Raycast extension compatibility (rejected: drags in Raycast's design
  language and API surface, competes with our plugin protocol); window management in the
  launcher (rejected: needs Accessibility, AeroSpace owns tiling); localised names and CJK
  romanisation as keywords (deferred, no demand — the role model is ready for them).

### 2026-09-16 · Reversal: scuttlarr updates itself, from `updates ⏎`

- **Decision.** The `updates` plugin gains a `scuttlarr` source (`selfupdate.rs`). Every
  6 h, on the same cadence as the package managers, the app reads GitHub's public
  `releases/latest` — the feed `release.json` is cut from — and, when a newer stable
  release exists, shows `scuttlarr 0.6.0 → 0.7.0`. `↵` on that row downloads the release
  zip, checks its sha256 against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, expands it, verifies the
  bundle's signature against the _running_ app's team (`codesign --verify --deep --strict
-R 'anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "<team>"'`), refuses a
  quarantined file rather than stripping the flag, swaps the bundle by two renames, and
  relaunches with `open -g` after the same teardown quitting runs. Nothing is installed
  unless every check passes; the running app survives any failure untouched, and a failure
  is the run's exit line with `t` (`brew upgrade --cask scuttlarr`) as the tty route. A
  dev or ad-hoc-signed build never offers it. `config.updates.checkSelf` (Settings →
  General, default on) is the switch: off means no request is ever made. `all` upgrades
  the package managers only; the app's own update relaunches and would cut a chain short.
- **Why.** The 2026-08-10 "no in-app updater, ever" rested on the zero-network invariant,
  retired 2026-09-04. What invariant 2 still bans is a request that exists to tell someone
  about the user; this one carries the app's name and nothing else, and is on the user's
  side of the line the way the favicon fetch is. `brew upgrade` stays the advertised
  channel; this is for the person who never runs it (Mitch, 2026-09-16). Verification is stronger than an appcast signature: the download must be
  code we signed, which the release pipeline already guarantees.
- **Alternatives.** `tauri-plugin-updater` (rejected: a new crate, a minisign key pair to
  mint and keep, a `latest.json` to generate, and it verifies less than `codesign` does);
  a Sparkle-style appcast (rejected: a second release fact to author — invariant 9);
  reading `scuttlarr.com/release.json` (rejected: the site deploys after the release commit
  lands, so it can briefly name an asset that does not exist yet).
- **Consequence for the tap.** The cask must declare `auto_updates true` so `brew outdated`
  stops reporting a self-updated app as stale (RELEASING.md); until `Casks/scuttlarr.rb`
  exists (plan step 1.5) there is nothing to change.

### 2026-09-16 · Live terminal retint is OSC into every pty; the Ghostty reload is an opt-in

- **Decision.** At `theme set`, the OSC colour payload goes into every `/dev/ttysNNN` the
  user owns (owner = `$HOME`'s uid, no libc binding) plus tmux's pane ttys — not tmux
  panes only. That is the baseline: every open shell, in Ghostty, Terminal.app or
  anything else, changes on the spot with no permission, because writing to a tty you
  own is ordinary Unix. On top, `appearance.ghostty` (off by default, "Also reload
  Ghostty's config" in Settings) sends `tell application "Ghostty" to perform action
"reload_config" on first terminal` so open Ghostty windows take the whole rendered
  file, not just colours — one Automation consent, first time. It runs only when a
  Ghostty process exists (`tell application` would launch one), and after the OSC, which
  still covers whatever the reload cannot reach.
- **Why.** The Omarchy moment is the terminal changing under you; on Linux that is
  `SIGUSR2`, which on macOS kills Ghostty (JOURNAL 2026-09-11). Gating the headline on an
  Automation prompt would invert invariant 1, so the consent-free route is the default
  and the prompt buys fidelity, not function.
- **Alternatives.** AppleScript only (rejected: prompt-gated, Ghostty-only, Terminal.app
  untouched); `SIGUSR2` (rejected: kills the process); Accessibility-driven menu clicks
  (rejected: invariant 1). Terminal.app profile colours over its own dictionary:
  deferred, the OSC already reaches its open windows.
