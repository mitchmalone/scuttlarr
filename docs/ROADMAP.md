# ROADMAP

> Milestones and backlog. What we build next lives here; what's happening now lives in
> `STATUS.md`; how a specific task gets built lives in `plans/`. Milestones and exit criteria
> are from `PRD.md` §9 — this file tracks their state, the PRD stays the source for scope.

## v1 milestones

All v1 milestones below are **code-complete as of 2026-08-08**.

- **M0 — Spike (the scary parts first).** ✅ Tauri 2 + tauri-nspanel: hotkey summons a
  non-activating panel with a text field; Esc restores focus correctly over a full-screen app.
  _Exit: the focus dance works or the stack decision gets revisited._
  → `plans/done/m0-nspanel-spike.md` (verified by Mitch, incl. full-screen + second display)
- **M1 — Launcher.** ✅ Index + fuzzy match + launch + System Settings panes. No frecency, ugly UI.
  _Exit: Mitch can launch any app._
- **M2 — Feel.** ✅ (instrumented: cold start 163ms, summon 3.7ms) Frecency, keyboard bindings, terminal-prompt visual identity, performance
  instrumentation against the budgets. _Exit: launcharr replaces the incumbent daily launcher._
- **M3 — Bang mode.** ✅ `!` grammar dispatch, iTerm2 hand-off, Terminal.app fallback, config file.
  _Exit: `!git status ⏎` feels better than switching to iTerm2 by hand._
- **M4 — Polish & daily use.** 🔄 Launch-at-login + first-run hint shipped; features and
  fixes ship continuously. _Exit: launcharr is the incumbent and nothing broken survives
  a week._

## v1.1 — Sol parity, scripts-first ✅ (2026-08-08, overnight)

Script protocol (v2's flagship, pulled forward) + bundled lorem/json/ip scripts, clipboard
history (copy-on-Enter, concealed-safe), inline math, custom links, custom shortcuts. Scope
negotiation in DECISIONS (zero-network + zero-permissions held; Translate/Calendar/public-IP
deferred). Record: `plans/done/v1.1-scripts-and-sol-parity.md`.

## v1.2 — release core ✅ (2026-08-09) — v0.2.0

System commands, ⌥⏎ secondary actions, opt-in bookmarks, emoji picker, settings window,
README/RELEASING. Ship blocked only on signing (Mitch's Apple Developer ID).
Record: `plans/done/v1.2-release-core.md`. Deferred by choice: file search (mdfind route
documented), dx pack (tmux/projects/ssh/ports — see 2026-08-09 brainstorm in git history).

## v0.4 — the control surface ✅ (released 2026-08-17)

Decided 2026-08-15 as "v0.5 — the bar" (DECISIONS entry); renumbered at release because
0.4 shipped it all: launcharr grows a menubar replacement, TUI panels, agent monitoring
and a wrapped AeroSpace desktop layer; launcher, bar, and tiling are independently
toggleable. Not a distro — bar + launcher + config only. Record: docs/releases/v0.4.0.md.

- **B0 — TUI kit.** ✅ (2026-08-15) `packages/tui`: Omarchy-inspired component library
  with keyboard-nav logic TDD'd. _Exit met: bar + panels compose from the kit._
- **B1 — Bar spike (gate).** ✅ (2026-08-15) _Exit met: ~19 MB marginal (shared WebKit
  pool) — gate PASSED; numbers in plans/done/v0.5-tui-kit-and-bar-spike.md._
- **B2 — Bar core.** ✅ Mitch's daily menubar (Sketchybar retired 2026-08-16); zones +
  drag arranger, notch profiles, battery hover card, wifi SSID, awake cell; a bar per
  display + launcher on the mouse's screen (2026-08-19). Left for v0.5: per-monitor
  workspaces, app hints, event-driven front-app, bluetooth glyph.
- **B3 — Desktop layer.** ✅ (2026-08-17, was "Aerospace wrap") AeroSpace as a cask
  dependency (never vendored), generated opinionated config with adopt-or-leave and a
  managed/unmanaged switch (edit / use my own / save a copy), opt-in JankyBorders,
  corner radius. _Exit met: fresh Mac gets working tiling without seeing a toml._
- **B4 — Agents.** ✅ Agent bar cells + `agents ⏎` + `usage ⏎` + `?` mode
  (plans/done/agent-monitoring.md). Module API deferred to v0.5.
- **P0 — Panel framework + wifi.** ✅ (2026-08-16) `wifi ⏎`, `dns ⏎`; PANELS registry
  makes tenants one-entry cheap.
- **P1 — Panel tenants.** ✅ audio, clipboard, awake, aerospace, help, **screenshots**
  (`ss ⏎`, plans/done/screenshots-panel.md — first grid + scrolling panel). Settings
  migration deferred to v0.5.
- **W0 — tui workbench.** ✅ (2026-08-16) Story-driven state coverage, no Storybook dep.

## v0.5 — plugins (next; scope talk pending)

**Plugins landed 2026-08-27** (DECISIONS ×3, `plans/done/plugins-react-cells-and-panels.md`,
`docs/PLUGINS.md`): plugins are code — `cell.tsx` / `panel.tsx` on `@scuttlarr/tui`,
`service.ts` in Bun (stream or tick), manifest `kinds`, `bun build` + blob-URL loading with
hot-swap, Settings → Menubar → Plugins (git install, on/off, restart), `plugins ⏎` gallery.
First-party `usage` and `calendar` are plugins (`packages/plugins/`, native state
providers); the reference `hello` plugin is `apps/desktop/plugins/hello/`. Omarchy QML
plugins on macOS studied and rejected. **Rolling (slice G):** the remaining first-party
panels (awake, agents, wifi, audio, battery) move to plugins as they are touched. The
widget items below are absorbed.

Candidates carried over from v0.4, to be cut down in the 0.5 scope session:

- **Module API** — ✅ **widgets** (2026-08-19, plans/done/widgets.md; DECISIONS
  2026-08-19 ×2): TypeScript files in `~/.config/scuttlarr/widgets/` run under Bun
  (`runtime.rs`; any executable works too), `manifest`/`tick` JSON, generic cell + card,
  live dir watch, `triggers/widget.<id>`, Settings → Menubar → Custom widgets (install
  from URL/file, tick, remove). Reference widgets uptime / github-actions / vercel /
  trmnl in `apps/desktop/widgets/`; bundled scripts are TS too. Left: a curated widget
  index for install-from-URL, `widgets ⏎` panel, custom SVG icons, event-driven
  (`watch`) widgets, a left-zone card anchor, wifi glyph footprint fix.
- **Multi-display** — ✅ bar per display, launcher on the mouse's screen (2026-08-19,
  plans/done/multi-display.md). Left: per-monitor workspace lists (aerospace
  `--monitor`), a screen-parameters observer instead of the 5 s heartbeat.
- **Bar polish** — glyph-only strip landed 2026-08-19 (DECISIONS: wifi arcs, battery
  tiers by adjusted charge, awake timer card-side). Left: NSWorkspace-observer front-app,
  bluetooth glyph; per-workspace app hints only as hover. (Vercel / GitHub Actions /
  uptime landed as widgets, 2026-08-19.)
- **Settings into panels** — the native window retires (re-decide: 0.4 invested in it).
  Drill-down panel menu.
- **awake loose ends** — timed agents-idle release observed end-to-end, lid-closed-on-AC,
  slice E. (Relaunch persistence shipped 2026-08-19, DECISIONS.)
- **Site/app single-source gaps** — `PANEL_INFO` is hand-mirrored in `apps/www`
  (invariant 10 smell); extract to a package.
- **PRD revision pass** — ✅ 2026-09-11 for §1–§3 and §10 (vision, target user, non-goals,
  horizon: the rungs). §4–§9 still describe v1 behaviour; DECISIONS 2026-08-15 remains the
  scope source for bar/panel questions.

## Unification into scuttlarr (DECISIONS 2026-09-11)

One repo, one product, renamed scuttlarr; the launcher is a feature. Plan and phases:
`plans/active/2026-09-11-unify-into-scuttlarr.md` — record → rename → port setup →
theme package (Omarchy model) → theme policy + switcher (macOS Focus, light/dark by
system or schedule) → docs. Retires the "scuttlarr contract" below; its open items map to
plan steps.

<details><summary>Retired: scuttlarr contract (DECISIONS 2026-08-25)</summary>

- **Light mode** — now plan step 3.7 (Solarized Light + Catppuccin Latte render every surface).
- **Ghostty hand-off** — ✅ 2026-09-04 (DECISIONS, `plans/active/ghostty-handoff.md`). Left:
  live-prove `!echo hi ⏎` and the updates `a` upgrade path against a running herdr server (Mitch).
- **Typed `desktop` schema** — now plan step 3.3 (borders/aerospace rendered from the palette).
- **Dark-mode delegation** — now plan step 4.4 ("Toggle Dark Mode" flips `appearance.mode`).

## v2 horizon (recorded now, built later — PRD §10)

| Item                                                      | Trigger                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Per-query learned bindings (schema already records query) | Frecency data shows repeated query→pick                      |
| Richer bangs (`!!` repeat, project-scoped commands)       | Bang mode proves itself daily                                |
| Theming beyond the built-in look                          | ✅ 2026-09-11 — the Theme rung (`THEMES.md`)                 |
| Signing, notarization, public README                      | Releasing to the wild (auto-update ✅ 2026-09-16, DECISIONS) |
| Move matching to Rust                                     | R2 fires: WKWebView can't hold the 16 ms keystroke budget    |

## Explicitly not doing (non-goals — load-bearing, PRD §3, amended by v0.4)

File search, snippets, Windows/Linux. Still true for the **launcher core**: zero
permissions (zero network was retired 2026-09-04 — DECISIONS). Amended by DECISIONS
2026-08-15/16 for v0.4: window management arrives _wrapped_ (Aerospace, which brings its own
Accessibility grant — scuttlarr itself still requests nothing), and bar **modules** may be
credentialed + networked per-module, fail-visible (TRMNL was the first; pulled 2026-08-17
pending the plugin API). **"Anything distro-shaped" left this list 2026-09-11** (DECISIONS):
it was a separate repo from 2026-08-25, and is now the Machine rung (`SETUP.md`); light mode
is a palette in the Theme rung (`THEMES.md`). The PRD's §1–§3 were revised the same day.
