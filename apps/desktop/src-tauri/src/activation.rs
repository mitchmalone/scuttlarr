//! App activation. scuttlarr is an Accessory app and the launcher panel is
//! non-activating, so when a regular window (settings) is created or re-shown
//! from the panel, scuttlarr is *not* the active app: tao orders the window
//! front within scuttlarr but whatever app was in front stays in front and the
//! window lands behind it (Mitch, 2026-08-19). Regular windows call this after
//! ordering front.
